Ohmâ€™s Law
Introduction
Ohmâ€™s Law is a fundamental principle in electrical circuits that defines the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance. It was formulated by Georg Simon Ohm in 1827.

Statement of Ohmâ€™s Law

The current flowing through a conductor between two points is directly proportional to the voltage across those points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor.

Mathematical Formula:
V=IÃ—RV = I \times RV=IÃ—R
where:

VVV = Voltage (Volts, V)
III = Current (Amperes, A)
RRR = Resistance (Ohms, Î©\OmegaÎ©)


Forms of Ohmâ€™s Law:
To find Voltage (V):
V=IÃ—RV = I \times RV=IÃ—R
To find Current (I):
I=VRI = \frac{V}{R}I=RVâ€‹
To find Resistance (R):
R=VIR = \frac{V}{I}R=IVâ€‹

Key Components Explained:
1. Voltage (V):

Electrical potential difference between two points.
Measured in Volts (V).

2. Current (I):

Flow of electric charge through a conductor.
Measured in Amperes (A).

3. Resistance (R):

Opposition to the flow of current in a circuit.
Measured in Ohms ( Î©\OmegaÎ© ).


Graphical Representation of Ohmâ€™s Law:

The relationship between VVV and III is linear for a constant resistance.
The slope of the V-I curve is the resistance.


Applications of Ohmâ€™s Law:

Circuit Analysis: Calculating voltage, current, and resistance in electrical circuits.
Electrical Components: Designing resistors and other circuit elements.
Power Calculation: Used to derive the power formula.


Limitations of Ohmâ€™s Law:

Not applicable to non-linear devices like diodes and transistors.
Only valid for metallic conductors where temperature remains constant.

Solution:
Using Ohmâ€™s Law:
V=IÃ—R=2Ã—10=20VV = I \times R = 2 \times 10 = 20VV=IÃ—R=2Ã—10=20V
Answer: The voltage across the resistor is 20 V.

Source Transformation
Introduction
Source Transformation is a technique used in circuit analysis to simplify complex circuits by converting between equivalent voltage and current sources. It is based on Ohmâ€™s Law and helps in reducing the complexity of solving circuits.

Principle of Source Transformation:
A voltage source with a series resistance can be converted into an equivalent current source with a parallel resistance, and vice versa.
Mathematical Relationships:

Voltage Source to Current Source:
I=VRI = \frac{V}{R}I=RVâ€‹
Current Source to Voltage Source:
V=IÃ—RV = I \times RV=IÃ—R

where:

VVV = Voltage (Volts)
III = Current (Amperes)
RRR = Resistance (Ohms)


Voltage Source to Current Source Transformation:

Given: A voltage source VVV in series with a resistance RRR.
Converted To: A current source of value I=VRI = \frac{V}{R}I=RVâ€‹ in parallel with the same resistance RRR.

Symbolic Representation:

Voltage Source: A circle with a +++ and âˆ’-âˆ’ sign and a series resistor.
Current Source: A circle with an arrow and a parallel resistor.


Current Source to Voltage Source Transformation:

Given: A current source III in parallel with a resistance RRR.
Converted To: A voltage source of value V=IÃ—RV = I \times RV=IÃ—R in series with the same resistance RRR.

Symbolic Representation:

Current Source: A circle with an arrow and a parallel resistor.
Voltage Source: A circle with a +++ and âˆ’-âˆ’ sign and a series resistor.


Key Points to Remember:

The resistance remains the same during transformation.
The transformed sources must produce the same voltage-current relationship at their terminals.


Example Problem:
Convert a voltage source to a current source:

Given:

Voltage source: V=12VV = 12VV=12V

Limitations:

Only valid for linear circuits.
Not applicable for non-linear components like diodes or transistors.


Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws
Introduction
Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws are fundamental principles in electrical circuit analysis, developed by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1845. These laws help in analyzing complex electrical circuits by defining the relationships between currents and voltages in a circuit.

1. Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law (KCL)
Statement:

The algebraic sum of all currents entering a node (junction) is equal to the sum of all currents leaving the node.

Mathematical Form:
âˆ‘Iin=âˆ‘Iout\sum I_\text{in} = \sum I_\text{out}âˆ‘Iinâ€‹=âˆ‘Ioutâ€‹
Explanation:

A node is a point where two or more circuit elements meet.
Currents entering the node are considered positive, and currents leaving the node are considered negative (or vice versa, depending on sign convention).

Example:
At a node with currents:
I1+I2=I3+I4I_1 + I_2 = I_3 + I_4I1â€‹+I2â€‹=I3â€‹+I4â€‹
Applications:

Solving complex circuits with multiple nodes.
Balancing current flow in parallel circuits.


2. Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL)
Statement:

The algebraic sum of all voltages around a closed loop in a circuit is zero.

Mathematical Form:
âˆ‘V=0\sum V = 0âˆ‘V=0
Explanation:

A loop is a closed path where the starting and ending points are the same.
Voltage drops across resistors are taken as negative (consuming energy).
Voltage rises across sources are taken as positive (supplying energy).

Example:
In a loop containing a voltage source and resistors:
Vsource=V1+V2+V3V_\text{source} = V_1 + V_2 + V_3Vsourceâ€‹=V1â€‹+V2â€‹+V3â€‹
or

Applications:

Current splits between two branches after the source.

Using KCL:
At the node:
I=I1+I2I = I_1 + I_2I=I1â€‹+I2â€‹

By KCL:
I=I1+I2=2+3=5AI = I_1 + I_2 = 2 + 3 = 5AI=I1â€‹+I2â€‹=2+3=5A

Applications of Kirchhoffâ€™s Laws:

Analyzing complex circuits with multiple loops and branches.
Forming the foundation for Mesh Analysis and Nodal Analysis.
Valid in DC and AC circuits.


Limitations:

Applicable only in lumped circuits (where elements are localized).
Assumes constant physical properties (resistance, capacitance).

Mesh Analysis
Introduction
Mesh Analysis (also called the Mesh Current Method) is a systematic technique used to calculate the current in electrical circuits with multiple loops. It is based on Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL), which states that the sum of all voltages around a closed loop is zero.

Definition:

Mesh Analysis involves assigning a mesh current to each independent loop in the circuit and using KVL to write equations for the loops to solve for the currents.


Key Concepts:
1. Mesh:

A mesh is a loop in a circuit that does not enclose other loops.
Each mesh is assigned a unique mesh current (clockwise is usually standard).

2. Kirchhoffâ€™s Voltage Law (KVL) Application:

Apply KVL to each mesh and write equations where the sum of voltage drops equals zero.


Steps for Mesh Analysis:
Step 1: Identify the Meshes

Count the number of independent loops in the circuit.

Step 2: Assign Mesh Currents

Assign a unique mesh current to each loop (clockwise convention is preferred).

Step 3: Apply KVL to Each Mesh

Write KVL equations for each loop:
âˆ‘V=0\sum V = 0âˆ‘V=0

Step 4: Solve the Simultaneous Equations

Solve the system of linear equations to find the mesh currents.


Example Problem:
Given Circuit:

Voltage Source: V=12VV = 12VV=12V
R1=6Î©R_1 = 6 \OmegaR1â€‹=6Î©, R2=4Î©R_2 = 4 \OmegaR2â€‹=4Î©, R3=2Î©R_3 = 2 \OmegaR3â€‹=2Î©

Step 1: Assign Mesh Currents:

Mesh 1: I1I_1I1â€‹
Mesh 2: I2I_2I2â€‹

Step 2: Write KVL Equations:
For Mesh 1:
12âˆ’(6I1)âˆ’(4(I1âˆ’I2))=012 - (6I_1) - (4(I_1 - I_2)) = 012âˆ’(6I1â€‹)âˆ’(4(I1â€‹âˆ’I2â€‹))=0
Simplify:
12=10I1âˆ’4I212 = 10I_1 - 4I_212=10I1â€‹âˆ’4I2â€‹

For Mesh 2:
4(I2âˆ’I1)+2I2=04(I_2 - I_1) + 2I_2 = 04(I2â€‹âˆ’I1â€‹)+2I2â€‹=0
Simplify:
4I2âˆ’4I1+2I2=04I_2 - 4I_1 + 2I_2 = 04I2â€‹âˆ’4I1â€‹+2I2â€‹=0 âŸ¹ 6I2âˆ’4I1=06I_2 - 4I_1 = 06I2â€‹âˆ’4I1â€‹=0

Step 3: Solve Simultaneously:
From the two equations:

10I1âˆ’4I2=1210I_1 - 4I_2 = 1210I1â€‹âˆ’4I2â€‹=12
âˆ’4I1+6I2=0-4I_1 + 6I_2 = 0âˆ’4I1â€‹+6I2â€‹=0

Solving gives:
I1=2AI_1 = 2AI1â€‹=2A, I2=1.33AI_2 = 1.33AI2â€‹=1.33A

Advantages of Mesh Analysis:

Simplifies circuit analysis for planar circuits.
Reduces the number of equations compared to node analysis for specific cases.


Limitations:

Applicable only to planar circuits (circuits that can be drawn without crossing wires).
Less effective for circuits with many independent voltage sources.

Nodal Analysis
Introduction
Nodal Analysis (also called the Node Voltage Method) is a systematic technique used to determine the voltages at various points (nodes) in an electrical circuit. It is based on Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law (KCL), which states that the sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node.

Key Concepts:
Node:

A point where two or more circuit elements meet.
Each node has a node voltage relative to a reference point (ground).

Reference Node (Ground):

One node is chosen as the reference node and is assigned a voltage of 0 V.

Non-Reference Nodes:

Principle of Nodal Analysis:

Assign a voltage variable for each non-reference node.
Apply KCL: The sum of currents entering a node equals the sum of currents leaving the node.
Express currents in terms of node voltages and resistances using Ohmâ€™s Law.


Steps for Nodal Analysis:
Step 1: Identify Nodes and Assign Voltages

Select a reference node (ground).
Label all non-reference nodes with voltages V1,V2,â€¦V_1, V_2, \ldotsV1â€‹,V2â€‹,â€¦.

Step 2: Apply Kirchhoffâ€™s Current Law (KCL)

For each non-reference node, apply KCL:
âˆ‘Iin=âˆ‘Iout\sum I_\text{in} = \sum I_\text{out}âˆ‘Iinâ€‹=âˆ‘Ioutâ€‹

Step 3: Express Currents Using Ohmâ€™s Law

I=VRI = \frac{V}{R}I=RVâ€‹.
Write currents in terms of node voltages and resistances.

Step 4: Solve the Simultaneous Equations

Solve the resulting simultaneous equations to find node voltages.

R1=6Î©R_1 = 6\OmegaR1â€‹=6Î©, R2=4Î©R_2 = 4\OmegaR2â€‹=4Î©, R3=2Î©R_3 = 2\OmegaR3â€‹=2Î©

Step 1: Identify Nodes:

Reference node: Ground
Nodes: V1V_1V1â€‹ and V2V_2V2â€‹


Step 2: Apply KCL:
At Node V1V_1V1â€‹:
V1âˆ’126+V1âˆ’V24=0\frac{V_1 - 12}{6} + \frac{V_1 - V_2}{4} = 06V1â€‹âˆ’12â€‹+4V1â€‹âˆ’V2â€‹â€‹=0
At Node V2V_2V2â€‹:
V2âˆ’V14+V22=0\frac{V_2 - V_1}{4} + \frac{V_2}{2} = 04V2â€‹âˆ’V1â€‹â€‹+2V2â€‹â€‹=0

Step 3: Solve the Equations:
Simplify the equations:

V1âˆ’126+V1âˆ’V24=0\frac{V_1 - 12}{6} + \frac{V_1 - V_2}{4} = 06V1â€‹âˆ’12â€‹+4V1â€‹âˆ’V2â€‹â€‹=0
V2âˆ’V14+V22=0\frac{V_2 - V_1}{4} + \frac{V_2}{2} = 04V2â€‹âˆ’V1â€‹â€‹+2V2â€‹â€‹=0

Solving simultaneously gives:

V1=9.6VV_1 = 9.6VV1â€‹=9.6V
V2=4.8VV_2 = 4.8VV2â€‹=4.8V


Advantages of Nodal Analysis:

For two resistors in parallel:
I1=ItotalÃ—R2R1+R2I_1 = I_{total} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}I1â€‹=Itotalâ€‹Ã—R1â€‹+R2â€‹R2â€‹â€‹
I2=ItotalÃ—R1R1+R2I_2 = I_{total} \times \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}I2â€‹=Itotalâ€‹Ã—R1â€‹+R2â€‹R1â€‹â€‹

Example Problem (CDR):
Given:

Current Source: Itotal=10AI_{total} = 10AItotalâ€‹=10A
R1=6Î©R_1 = 6 \OmegaR1â€‹=6Î©
R2=4Î©R_2 = 4 \OmegaR2â€‹=4Î©

Find the current through R1R_1R1â€‹:
I1=10Ã—46+4I_1 = 10 \times \frac{4}{6 + 4}I1â€‹=10Ã—6+44â€‹
I1=10Ã—410=4AI_1 = 10 \times \frac{4}{10} = 4AI1â€‹=10Ã—104â€‹=4A

Theveninâ€™s and Nortonâ€™s Theorems
Introduction
Theveninâ€™s and Nortonâ€™s Theorems are fundamental concepts in electrical circuit analysis that simplify complex circuits into simpler equivalent circuits. They help in analyzing circuits with multiple components by reducing them into a single voltage or current source with an equivalent resistance.

ðŸ“Œ Theveninâ€™s Theorem
Statement:

Any linear electrical circuit with multiple resistors and sources can be reduced to a single voltage source VthV_{th}Vthâ€‹ in series with an equivalent resistance RthR_{th}Rthâ€‹.

Theveninâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:

VthV_{th}Vthâ€‹: Theveninâ€™s equivalent voltage (open-circuit voltage).
RthR_{th}Rthâ€‹: Theveninâ€™s equivalent resistance.

Steps to Apply Theveninâ€™s Theorem:


Identify the Load:

Choose the component across which the circuit needs simplification.



Calculate Theveninâ€™s Equivalent Voltage VthV_{th}Vthâ€‹:

Remove the load resistor.
Calculate the open-circuit voltage across the load terminals.



Calculate Theveninâ€™s Equivalent Resistance RthR_{th}Rthâ€‹:

Turn off all independent sources (voltage sources shorted, current sources opened).
Calculate the equivalent resistance seen from the open terminals.



Draw Theveninâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:

Replace the original circuit with a voltage source VthV_{th}Vthâ€‹ in series with RthR_{th}Rthâ€‹.




Example Problem (Theveninâ€™s Theorem)
Given:

Voltage Source V=12VV = 12VV=12V
R1=6Î©R_1 = 6 \OmegaR1â€‹=6Î©, R2=4Î©R_2 = 4 \OmegaR2â€‹=4Î©
Load Resistor: RL=10Î©R_L = 10 \OmegaRLâ€‹=10Î©

Step 1: Remove RLR_LRLâ€‹.
Step 2: Calculate VthV_{th}Vthâ€‹ (voltage across open terminals):

Voltage divider rule:
Vth=VÃ—R2R1+R2V_{th} = V \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}Vthâ€‹=VÃ—R1â€‹+R2â€‹R2â€‹â€‹
Vth=12Ã—46+4=4.8VV_{th} = 12 \times \frac{4}{6 + 4} = 4.8VVthâ€‹=12Ã—6+44â€‹=4.8V

Step 3: Calculate RthR_{th}Rthâ€‹:

Turn off voltage source (replace with a short circuit).
Equivalent resistance:
Rth=R1âˆ£âˆ£R2=6Ã—46+4=2.4Î©R_{th} = R_1 || R_2 = \frac{6 \times 4}{6 + 4} = 2.4 \OmegaRthâ€‹=R1â€‹âˆ£âˆ£R2â€‹=6+46Ã—4â€‹=2.4Î©

âœ… Theveninâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:

Vth=4.8VV_{th} = 4.8VVthâ€‹=4.8V
Rth=2.4Î©R_{th} = 2.4 \OmegaRthâ€‹=2.4Î©


ðŸ“Œ Nortonâ€™s Theorem
Statement:

Any linear electrical circuit can be reduced to a single current source INI_{N}INâ€‹ in parallel with an equivalent resistance RNR_{N}RNâ€‹.

Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:

INI_NINâ€‹: Nortonâ€™s equivalent current (short-circuit current).
RNR_NRNâ€‹: Nortonâ€™s equivalent resistance (same as Theveninâ€™s equivalent resistance).

Steps to Apply Nortonâ€™s Theorem:


Identify the Load:

Select the component across which the circuit will be simplified.



Calculate Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Current INI_NINâ€‹:

Short the load resistor.
Calculate the short-circuit current across the load terminals.



Calculate Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Resistance RNR_NRNâ€‹:

Same as Theveninâ€™s resistance.
Turn off all independent sources and calculate the equivalent resistance across the terminals.



Draw Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:

Replace the circuit with a current source INI_NINâ€‹ in parallel with RNR_NRNâ€‹.




Example Problem (Nortonâ€™s Theorem)
Given:

Voltage Source V=12VV = 12VV=12V
R1=6Î©R_1 = 6 \OmegaR1â€‹=6Î©, R2=4Î©R_2 = 4 \OmegaR2â€‹=4Î©
Load Resistor: RL=10Î©R_L = 10 \OmegaRLâ€‹=10Î©

Step 1: Remove RLR_LRLâ€‹.
Step 2: Calculate INI_NINâ€‹ (short-circuit current):

Short circuit the load terminals:
IN=VR1+R2=1210=1.2AI_N = \frac{V}{R_1 + R_2} = \frac{12}{10} = 1.2AINâ€‹=R1â€‹+R2â€‹Vâ€‹=1012â€‹=1.2A

Step 3: Calculate RNR_NRNâ€‹ (same as RthR_{th}Rthâ€‹):

RN=R1âˆ£âˆ£R2=2.4Î©R_N = R_1 || R_2 = 2.4 \OmegaRNâ€‹=R1â€‹âˆ£âˆ£R2â€‹=2.4Î©

âœ… Nortonâ€™s Equivalent Circuit:

IN=1.2AI_N = 1.2AINâ€‹=1.2A
RN=2.4Î©R_N = 2.4 \OmegaRNâ€‹=2.4Î©


ðŸ“Œ Relationship Between Theveninâ€™s and Nortonâ€™s Theorems:

The Theveninâ€™s Voltage Source can be converted into a Nortonâ€™s Current Source and vice versa.
Conversion Formulas:

Vth=INÃ—RNV_{th} = I_N \times R_NVthâ€‹=INâ€‹Ã—RNâ€‹
IN=VthRthI_N = \frac{V_{th}}{R_{th}}INâ€‹=Rthâ€‹Vthâ€‹â€‹
