Single Phase Transformer: Construction & Working Principle
Introduction
A single-phase transformer is a static electrical device used to transfer electrical energy from one circuit to another through electromagnetic induction. It operates on the principle of mutual induction and works only with alternating current (AC).

Construction of Single Phase Transformer
A single-phase transformer mainly consists of the following parts:
1. Core:

The core is made from laminated silicon steel sheets to reduce eddy current losses.
It provides a low reluctance path for the magnetic flux.

2. Windings:

Primary winding: Connected to the input AC supply and generates magnetic flux when current flows through it.
Secondary winding: Connected to the load, where the induced voltage is transferred from the primary winding.
Both windings are made of copper for high conductivity.

3. Insulation:

Insulating materials such as paper or varnish separate the windings and prevent short circuits.

4. Tank:

The outer casing that houses the core and windings. It may be filled with transformer oil for cooling and insulation.



Working Principle of Single Phase Transformer
A transformer works based on Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction, which states that a change in magnetic flux induces an electromotive force (EMF) in a conductor.
Step-by-Step Working:

AC Supply Applied:

An AC voltage is applied to the primary winding.


Magnetic Flux Generation:

Current flows through the primary coil, generating a time-varying magnetic flux in the core.


Mutual Induction:

The magnetic flux links both the primary and secondary windings.


Induced EMF in Secondary:

This varying flux induces an EMF (voltage) in the secondary winding.


Load Connection:

When a load is connected to the secondary winding, current flows through it, supplying power to the load.




Key Formula: Transformation Ratio
The transformation ratio determines the relationship between the primary and secondary voltage:
VpVs=NpNs\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}Vs​Vp​​=Ns​Np​​
Where:

VpV_pVp​ = Primary Voltage
VsV_sVs​ = Secondary Voltage
NpN_pNp​ = Number of turns in the primary winding
NsN_sNs​ = Number of turns in the secondary winding


Types of Single Phase Transformers:

Step-Up Transformer: Vs>VpV_s > V_pVs​>Vp​ (Increases Voltage)
Step-Down Transformer: Vs<VpV_s < V_pVs​<Vp​ (Decreases Voltage)
Isolation Transformer: Vs=VpV_s = V_pVs​=Vp​ (Same Voltage)


Advantages of Single Phase Transformer:

Simple design and construction.
High efficiency.

Conclusion:
A single-phase transformer is a fundamental electrical device used for efficient voltage conversion. It operates on the principle of mutual induction and plays a crucial role in both step-up and step-down power applications.

Simple Problems on Transformation Ratio
Introduction
The transformation ratio (also called the turn ratio) defines the relationship between the primary and secondary voltage of a transformer based on the number of turns in each winding.
The formula for the transformation ratio is:
VpVs=NpNs=IsIp\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s} = \frac{I_s}{I_p}Vs​Vp​​=Ns​Np​​=Ip​Is​​
Where:

VpV_pVp​ = Primary Voltage
VsV_sVs​ = Secondary Voltage
NpN_pNp​ = Number of turns in the primary winding
NsN_sNs​ = Number of turns in the secondary winding
IpI_pIp​ = Primary Current
IsI_sIs​ = Secondary Current


Problem 1: Step-Up Transformer Calculation
A transformer has 500 turns on the primary side and 1000 turns on the secondary side. If the primary voltage is 230 V, calculate the secondary voltage.
Solution:
Using the transformation ratio formula:
VpVs=NpNs\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}Vs​Vp​​=Ns​Np​​
Rearrange to solve for VsV_sVs​:
Vs=NsNp×VpV_s = \frac{N_s}{N_p} \times V_pVs​=Np​Ns​​×Vp​
Substitute the values:
Vs=1000500×230=2×230=460 VV_s = \frac{1000}{500} \times 230 = 2 \times 230 = 460 \ VVs​=5001000​×230=2×230=460 V
Answer: The secondary voltage is 460 V.

Problem 2: Step-Down Transformer Calculation
A transformer has 200 turns on the primary winding and 50 turns on the secondary winding. If the secondary voltage is 25 V, calculate the primary voltage.
Solution:
Using the same formula:
VpVs=NpNs\frac{V_p}{V_s} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}Vs​Vp​​=Ns​Np​​
Rearrange to solve for VpV_pVp​:
Vp=NpNs×VsV_p = \frac{N_p}{N_s} \times V_sVp​=Ns​Np​​×Vs​
Substitute the values:
Vp=20050×25=4×25=100 VV_p = \frac{200}{50} \times 25 = 4 \times 25 = 100 \ VVp​=50200​×25=4×25=100 V
Answer: The primary voltage is 100 V.

Problem 3: Current Transformation in a Step-Up Transformer
A step-up transformer has a primary current of 10 A. If the primary and secondary turns are 300 and 600 respectively, calculate the secondary current.
Solution:
The current ratio is inversely proportional to the turns ratio:
IsIp=NpNs\frac{I_s}{I_p} = \frac{N_p}{N_s}Ip​Is​​=Ns​Np​​
Rearrange to solve for IsI_sIs​:
Is=NpNs×IpI_s = \frac{N_p}{N_s} \times I_pIs​=Ns​Np​​×Ip​
Substitute the values:
Is=300600×10=0.5×10=5 AI_s = \frac{300}{600} \times 10 = 0.5 \times 10 = 5 \ AIs​=600300​×10=0.5×10=5 A
Answer: The secondary current is 5 A.

Key Observations:

Step-Up Transformer: Secondary voltage increases, secondary current decreases.
Step-Down Transformer: Secondary voltage decreases, secondary current increases.

Single Phase Induction Motor: Double Revolving Field Theory and Working Principle
Introduction
A Single-Phase Induction Motor (SPIM) is a type of AC motor used in low-power applications where a three-phase supply is unavailable. Unlike three-phase motors, it requires an auxiliary method to start due to its inability to self-start. To explain its working, the Double Revolving Field Theory is commonly used.

Double Revolving Field Theory
The Double Revolving Field Theory is used to explain the working of a single-phase induction motor. It states that:
Key Concept:

A single-phase alternating current produces a pulsating magnetic field, not a rotating one.
This pulsating magnetic field can be mathematically represented as the sum of two rotating magnetic fields of equal magnitude but opposite directions.

How it Works:

The single-phase AC supply produces a pulsating magnetic field.
This field can be divided into two rotating magnetic fields:

One rotating clockwise.
One rotating counterclockwise.


When the rotor is stationary, these opposing forces cancel each other, leading to zero net torque.
To start the motor, an external method (like a starting winding) is required to create initial rotation.
Once the motor starts rotating, the backward rotating field weakens due to rotor inertia, and the motor continues to run based on the forward rotating magnetic field.


Mathematical Representation:
The pulsating magnetic field B(t)B(t)B(t) can be expressed as:
B(t)=Bmaxcos⁡(ωt)B(t) = B_{max} \cos(\omega t)B(t)=Bmax​cos(ωt)
This can be split into two rotating fields:
B1(t)=Bmax2cos⁡(ωt)B_1(t) = \frac{B_{max}}{2} \cos(\omega t)B1​(t)=2Bmax​​cos(ωt)
B2(t)=Bmax2cos⁡(ωt+180∘)B_2(t) = \frac{B_{max}}{2} \cos(\omega t + 180^\circ)B2​(t)=2Bmax​​cos(ωt+180∘)

Need for Diagram:
A diagram would be helpful to visualize the two rotating fields and the resultant magnetic effect.

Working Principle of Single Phase Induction Motor
A single-phase induction motor works based on Faraday’s Law of Electromagnetic Induction and Double Revolving Field Theory.
Step-by-Step Working:

AC Supply Applied:

When AC supply is given to the stator winding, it generates a pulsating magnetic field.


Magnetic Field Decomposition:

The pulsating magnetic field is split into two rotating fields of equal magnitude but opposite direction.


Initial Condition (Rotor Stationary):

When the rotor is stationary, no net torque is produced due to the cancellation of both fields.


Starting the Motor (Using Auxiliary Winding):

To start the motor, an auxiliary winding or capacitor is added to create a phase difference between the currents.
This phase difference generates an unbalanced magnetic field, providing initial torque.


Continuous Rotation:

Once the rotor starts moving, the backward rotating field weakens, and the motor continues to rotate due to the forward rotating magnetic field.




Key Formula for Torque (Simplified):
The net torque developed by the motor is proportional to the magnetic flux:
T∝Bmax×IT \propto B_{max} \times IT∝Bmax​×I
Where:

TTT = Torque
BmaxB_{max}Bmax​ = Maximum Magnetic Flux
III = Current Flow


Starting Methods for Single Phase Induction Motor:
Since single-phase motors cannot self-start, they use external mechanisms:
1. Split Phase Motor:

Uses an additional starting winding with a higher resistance.
Once the motor reaches a certain speed, the starting winding disconnects via a centrifugal switch.

2. Capacitor Start Motor:

Uses a capacitor in series with the starting winding.
The capacitor creates a phase difference between the two windings, improving starting torque.

3. Capacitor Start Capacitor Run Motor:

Two capacitors used:

Starting Capacitor for initial high torque.
Running Capacitor for continuous efficiency.



4. Shaded Pole Motor:

Simplest design with shading coils around part of the pole.
Produces a weak rotating magnetic field but low efficiency.


Advantages of Single Phase Induction Motors:

Simple design and construction.
Cost-effective for low-power applications.
Reliable and requires minimal maintenance.

Disadvantages:

Not self-starting without auxiliary methods.
Lower efficiency compared to three-phase motors.
Limited to low-power applications.


Applications of Single Phase Induction Motors:

Household appliances (fans, refrigerators, washing machines).
Small water pumps.
Air conditioning units.
Blowers and exhaust fans.


Conclusion:
The Single Phase Induction Motor works on the principle of the Double Revolving Field Theory and requires an external method for starting. Its simplicity and reliability make it suitable for household and low-power industrial applications.

Starting Methods of Single Phase Induction Motor
Introduction
A Single Phase Induction Motor (SPIM) is not self-starting because the alternating magnetic field produced by a single-phase supply creates two equal and opposite rotating magnetic fields that cancel each other when the rotor is stationary. Therefore, external mechanisms are required to initiate the rotation of the motor, known as starting methods.

1. Split Phase Induction Motor
Principle:
The motor uses two windings:

Main Winding: Connected directly to the AC supply.
Starting Winding: Connected in parallel with a higher resistance.

Working:

When the motor starts, both windings produce magnetic fields.
Due to the difference in current phase, a starting torque is generated.
Once the motor reaches about 75-80% of its rated speed, a centrifugal switch disconnects the starting winding.

Advantages:

Simple and inexpensive.
Disadvantages:
Low starting torque.
Not suitable for heavy loads.

Applications:

Fans, blowers, washing machines.


2. Capacitor Start Induction Motor
Principle:

Uses a capacitor in series with the starting winding to create a phase difference.

Working:

The capacitor improves the phase difference between the currents in the main and auxiliary windings.
Produces a higher starting torque than a split-phase motor.
The starting winding and capacitor disconnect once the motor reaches 75-80% speed.

Advantages:

Higher starting torque.
Suitable for moderate loads.
Disadvantages:
More expensive than split-phase motors.

Applications:

Air compressors, pumps, refrigerators.


3. Capacitor Start Capacitor Run Induction Motor
Principle:

Uses two capacitors:

Starting Capacitor: Provides high starting torque.
Running Capacitor: Improves running efficiency and power factor.



Working:

The starting capacitor is temporarily connected during startup.
After the motor reaches operating speed, the starting capacitor is disconnected, and the running capacitor remains.

Advantages:

High starting torque.
Improved running efficiency.
Disadvantages:
More complex and costly.

Applications:

Air conditioners, pumps, industrial fans.


4. Shaded Pole Induction Motor
Principle:

The stator pole is divided into two parts:

Main Pole.
Shaded Pole: A copper ring (shading coil) placed around a portion of the pole.



Working:

When AC supply is given, the shaded pole creates a delayed magnetic field.
This phase difference between the main and shaded poles produces a weak rotating magnetic field, causing the rotor to turn.

Advantages:

Simple and low-cost design.
Disadvantages:
Low starting torque.
Very low efficiency.

Applications:

Small fans, hair dryers, exhaust fans.


5. Repulsion Start Induction Motor
Principle:

Uses a repulsion motor design where a repulsion effect between magnetic poles causes the rotor to rotate.

Working:

The rotor is short-circuited, and a set of carbon brushes is placed on the commutator.
Initially, the motor operates on repulsion, creating high torque.
As the motor gains speed, the brushes are lifted, and it functions like a normal induction motor.

Advantages:

High starting torque.
Disadvantages:
Expensive and complex.
Applications:
Heavy-duty applications, grinders, lathes.
