Limitations of Classical Mechanics
Classical mechanics, developed by Isaac Newton, describes the motion of macroscopic objects effectively. However, it fails to explain several phenomena observed at atomic and subatomic levels.
Key Limitations:


Inapplicability to Microscopic Particles:

Classical mechanics cannot describe the behaviour of particles at the atomic and subatomic scale (like electrons and protons).



Failure in Explaining Black Body Radiation:

Classical mechanics could not explain the spectrum of black body radiation, leading to the ultraviolet catastrophe, where infinite energy was predicted at short wavelengths.



Photoelectric Effect:

Classical theory predicted that light of any frequency would eject electrons from a metal if the intensity was high enough. However, experimental observations showed that electrons were only ejected if the light exceeded a threshold frequency, irrespective of intensity.



Wave-Particle Duality:

Classical mechanics treats matter and light purely as particles and waves respectively, failing to account for their dual behaviour.



Stability of Atoms:

According to classical electromagnetism, electrons orbiting a nucleus should continuously emit radiation and eventually collapse into the nucleus. However, atoms are stable in reality.



Quantization of Energy Levels:

Classical mechanics cannot explain the discrete energy levels observed in atomic spectra.




De-Broglie Hypothesis for Matter Waves
Introduction:
In 1924, Louis de Broglie proposed the wave-particle duality hypothesis, suggesting that particles of matter also exhibit wave-like properties. This was a revolutionary extension of quantum theory.
De-Broglie Wavelength Formula:
The de-Broglie wavelength λ\lambdaλ associated with a particle is given by:
λ=hp\lambda = \frac{h}{p}λ=ph​
where:

λ\lambdaλ = Wavelength of the matter wave
hhh = Planck’s constant (6.626×10−34 Js)(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js})(6.626×10−34Js)
ppp = Momentum of the particle = mvmvmv (mass × velocity)

Derivation of De-Broglie Hypothesis:
De-Broglie derived his hypothesis by combining concepts from Planck’s quantum theory and Einstein’s theory of relativity.


Energy of a photon:
E=hfE = h fE=hf
where fff is the frequency of the wave.


Relativistic Energy:
E=mc2E = mc^2E=mc2


Equating both energies for a photon:
hf=mc2h f = mc^2hf=mc2


Since frequency is related to wavelength by f=cλf = \frac{c}{\lambda}f=λc​:
λ=hmc\lambda = \frac{h}{mc}λ=mch​


For a particle with momentum p=mvp = mvp=mv:
λ=hp\lambda = \frac{h}{p}λ=ph​


Significance of De-Broglie Hypothesis:

Wave-Particle Duality: Suggests that every particle has both particle-like and wave-like characteristics.
Experimental Verification: Confirmed experimentally by Davisson and Germer through the electron diffraction experiment.
Basis of Quantum Mechanics: Led to the development of Schrödinger’s wave equation.

Conditions for De-Broglie Wavelength to be Significant:

More prominent for small particles like electrons.
Negligible for macroscopic objects due to large mass and small wavelength.


💡 TIP: The smaller the mass of the particle, the more significant the wave nature.
📝 NOTE: De-Broglie’s hypothesis forms the foundation of modern quantum mechanics and the concept of wave functions.

Phase Velocity and Group Velocity
Phase Velocity
Phase velocity refers to the speed at which a single wave crest (or phase) propagates through space. It describes how the phase of the wave moves over time.
Formula:
The phase velocity vpv_pvp​ is defined as:
vp=ωkv_p = \frac{\omega}{k}vp​=kω​
where:

vpv_pvp​ = Phase velocity
ω\omegaω = Angular frequency (2πf)(2\pi f)(2πf)
kkk = Wave number (2π/λ)(2\pi/\lambda)(2π/λ)
fff = Frequency of the wave
λ\lambdaλ = Wavelength


💡 TIP: Phase velocity can sometimes exceed the speed of light but does not violate relativity as no physical information travels faster than light.


Group Velocity
Group velocity refers to the speed at which the overall shape or envelope of a wave packet (a group of superimposed waves) propagates. It is associated with the transmission of energy or information.
Formula:
The group velocity vgv_gvg​ is defined as:
vg=dωdkv_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}vg​=dkdω​
where:

vgv_gvg​ = Group velocity
ω\omegaω = Angular frequency
kkk = Wave number


📝 NOTE: Group velocity generally represents the speed of energy transfer and the actual motion of a particle in a wave packet.


Relationship Between Phase and Group Velocity:

In non-dispersive media:
vp=vgv_p = v_gvp​=vg​ (both velocities are equal)
In dispersive media:
vp≠vgv_p \neq v_gvp​=vg​ and the velocities depend on the frequency.


💡 TIP: A dispersive medium is where different frequencies travel at different speeds, such as a prism splitting white light into colors.


Physical Interpretation:

Phase Velocity: Speed of a single crest in a continuous wave.
Group Velocity: Speed of the overall wave packet, often linked with the actual energy transfer.


Mathematical Relationship (for non-relativistic particles):
Using De-Broglie’s relation, phase and group velocities can be related for a particle:


Phase velocity:
vp=ωk=Epv_p = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{E}{p}vp​=kω​=pE​


Group velocity:
vg=dωdk=pm=vv_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk} = \frac{p}{m} = vvg​=dkdω​=mp​=v


where:

EEE = Energy
ppp = Momentum
vvv = Particle’s velocity


📝 NOTE: Group velocity often corresponds to the actual speed at which a particle or energy propagates in quantum mechanics.


Wave Packet
A wave packet is a localized wave formed by the superposition of multiple waves with different wavelengths and frequencies. It describes a group of waves traveling together and is often used to represent particles in quantum mechanics.

Definition:
A wave packet can be defined as a collection of waves of different frequencies and wavelengths that interfere constructively over a limited region of space, creating a localized pulse.

Mathematical Representation:
A wave packet can be expressed as the superposition of harmonic waves:
Ψ(x,t)=∫−∞∞A(k)ei(kx−ωt) dk\Psi(x, t) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(k) e^{i(kx - \omega t)} \,dkΨ(x,t)=∫−∞∞​A(k)ei(kx−ωt)dk
where:

Ψ(x,t)\Psi(x, t)Ψ(x,t) = Wave function describing the wave packet
A(k)A(k)A(k) = Amplitude of the component wave
kkk = Wave number
ω\omegaω = Angular frequency
xxx and ttt = Position and time


Properties of a Wave Packet:

Localized Nature: Confined to a small region in space.
Combination of Waves: Formed by combining multiple harmonic waves with varying frequencies and wavelengths.
Group Velocity: The speed at which the wave packet propagates.
Phase Velocity: The speed at which individual wave crests within the packet move.


Phase and Group Velocity in Wave Packets:


Phase Velocity: Speed of individual wave crests.
vp=ωkv_p = \frac{\omega}{k}vp​=kω​


Group Velocity: Speed of the entire wave packet, often linked to energy transmission.
vg=dωdkv_g = \frac{d\omega}{dk}vg​=dkdω​



💡 TIP: Group velocity typically represents the speed at which energy or information is transmitted, while phase velocity describes the motion of the individual wave peaks.


Types of Wave Packets:


Dispersive Wave Packet:

Component waves have different velocities.
Spreads over time due to varying phase velocities.



Non-Dispersive Wave Packet:

All component waves travel at the same speed.
The shape remains constant over time.




Wave Packet in Quantum Mechanics:
In quantum mechanics, a wave packet represents the probability amplitude of a particle’s position and momentum. According to the De-Broglie Hypothesis, particles can be described by wave packets with the following properties:

Narrow Wave Packet: Well-defined position but uncertain momentum.
Broad Wave Packet: Poorly-defined position but well-defined momentum.

This is closely related to the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle:
ΔxΔp≥ℏ2\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}ΔxΔp≥2ℏ​
where:

Δx\Delta xΔx = Uncertainty in position
Δp\Delta pΔp = Uncertainty in momentum
ℏ\hbarℏ = Reduced Planck’s constant


Physical Significance:

Classical Analogy: A sound pulse traveling through air.
Quantum Mechanics: Describes particles as waves with uncertain position and momentum.


📝 NOTE: Wave packets help bridge the gap between classical and quantum mechanics by showing how particles can exhibit both wave-like and particle-like behavior.


Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
Introduction:
Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics proposed by Werner Heisenberg in 1927. It states that it is impossible to simultaneously determine both the exact position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision.

Mathematical Statement:
The uncertainty principle is mathematically expressed as:
ΔxΔp≥ℏ2\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}ΔxΔp≥2ℏ​
where:

Δx\Delta xΔx = Uncertainty in position
Δp\Delta pΔp = Uncertainty in momentum
ℏ\hbarℏ = Reduced Planck’s constant h2π≈1.054×10−34 Js\frac{h}{2\pi} \approx 1.054 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js}2πh​≈1.054×10−34Js


Explanation:

The product of uncertainties in position and momentum has a lower bound determined by Planck’s constant.
If we try to measure the position (xxx) with high precision, the momentum (ppp) becomes highly uncertain, and vice versa.


💡 TIP: The uncertainty principle arises not due to imperfections in measurement but from the fundamental nature of quantum particles.


Physical Interpretation:

Wave-Particle Duality: Particles exhibit both wave and particle properties, making precise measurement challenging.
Quantum Limitations: The principle sets a fundamental limit on what can be known, not a technological limitation.


Derivation (Conceptual Outline):

De-Broglie Wavelength: λ=hp\lambda = \frac{h}{p}λ=ph​
Wave Nature of Particles: A particle is described as a wave packet with a spread in kkk-values.
Fourier Transform Relations: The spread in position and momentum space are inversely related.

The result is the uncertainty relation:
ΔxΔp≥ℏ2\Delta x \Delta p \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}ΔxΔp≥2ℏ​

Consequences and Implications:

Non-Deterministic Nature:

Quantum mechanics is inherently probabilistic, not deterministic like classical mechanics.


Zero Point Energy:

Even in the ground state, particles have non-zero energy due to uncertainty.


Electron Cloud in Atoms:

Electrons do not have definite orbits but exist in probability clouds.


Energy-Time Uncertainty:
A related form of the principle:
ΔEΔt≥ℏ2\Delta E \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}ΔEΔt≥2ℏ​

Describes uncertainty between energy and measurement time.




Experimental Evidence:

Electron Diffraction: Confirmed the wave nature of particles and inherent uncertainty.
Gamma Ray Microscope (Heisenberg Thought Experiment): Demonstrates position and momentum limitations.


📝 NOTE: The uncertainty principle does not affect macroscopic objects due to their large mass, where uncertainties become negligible.


Real-World Applications:

Quantum Tunneling: Particles can pass through energy barriers due to uncertain position.
Spectroscopy: Line broadening is influenced by uncertainty in energy and time.
Microscopy Limits: Optical resolution limited by wavelength and uncertainty.


Conclusion:

Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.
It reveals the fundamental limitations on measurement, emphasizing the probabilistic nature of the microscopic world.


Compton Scattering
Introduction:
Compton Scattering is a quantum phenomenon where an X-ray or gamma photon collides with a free or loosely bound electron, resulting in a decrease in the photon’s energy and an increase in its wavelength. This phenomenon provides evidence for the particle nature of light.
Discovery:

Discovered by Arthur H. Compton in 1923.
Experimentally confirmed the dual nature of light and the existence of photons as discrete energy packets.


Explanation:
During the scattering process:

A high-energy photon (X-ray or gamma-ray) collides with an electron.
The photon transfers part of its energy to the electron, which is ejected.
The scattered photon has reduced energy and a longer wavelength than the incident photon.


Mathematical Derivation:
The change in the photon’s wavelength after scattering is called the Compton shift and is given by:
Δλ=λ′−λ=hmec(1−cos⁡θ)\Delta \lambda = \lambda' - \lambda = \frac{h}{m_e c} (1 - \cos \theta)Δλ=λ′−λ=me​ch​(1−cosθ)
where:

Δλ\Delta \lambdaΔλ = Change in wavelength (Compton shift)
λ′\lambda'λ′ = Scattered photon wavelength
λ\lambdaλ = Incident photon wavelength
hhh = Planck’s constant (6.626×10−34 Js)(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{Js})(6.626×10−34Js)
mem_eme​ = Electron rest mass (9.109×10−31 kg)(9.109 \times 10^{-31} \, \text{kg})(9.109×10−31kg)
ccc = Speed of light (3×108 m/s)(3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s})(3×108m/s)
θ\thetaθ = Scattering angle of the photon

The term hmec\frac{h}{m_e c}me​ch​ is called the Compton wavelength of the electron:
λc=hmec≈2.43×10−12 m\lambda_c = \frac{h}{m_e c} \approx 2.43 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{m}λc​=me​ch​≈2.43×10−12m

Energy Considerations:

Initial Photon Energy: E=hcλE = \frac{hc}{\lambda}E=λhc​
Final Photon Energy: E′=hcλ′E' = \frac{hc}{\lambda'}E′=λ′hc​
Kinetic Energy of the Electron: K=E−E′K = E - E'K=E−E′


💡 TIP: The greater the scattering angle θ\thetaθ, the larger the shift in wavelength and energy transfer to the electron.


Key Observations:

Wavelength Shift:

The shift in wavelength depends only on the angle θ\thetaθ.


Particle Nature of Light:

Confirms that photons behave as particles with quantized energy and momentum.


Conservation Laws:

Energy and momentum are conserved during the scattering process.




Experimental Verification:
Compton’s Experiment (1923):

X-rays were scattered from a graphite target.
A longer wavelength was observed for the scattered X-rays, confirming the theoretical predictions.


Significance and Applications:

Evidence for Photons: Proved the particle nature of electromagnetic radiation.
Quantum Mechanics Foundation: Validated the concept of wave-particle duality.
Medical Imaging: Basis for Compton scattering used in X-ray scattering techniques.
Astrophysics: Used to study high-energy cosmic rays.


📝 NOTE: Compton scattering plays a crucial role in the interaction of radiation with matter and is widely applied in both physics research and medical diagnostics.


Conclusion:

Compton Scattering provides key evidence for the quantum theory of light.
It illustrates the interaction between photons and matter, emphasizing the particle-like behaviour of light.


Wave Function
Introduction:
The wave function is a fundamental concept in quantum mechanics that describes the quantum state of a particle or system. It provides information about the probability amplitude of a particle’s position, momentum, and other physical properties.

Definition:
The wave function is typically represented by the symbol Ψ(x,t)\Psi(x, t)Ψ(x,t) and is a complex-valued function of position xxx and time ttt.
Mathematical Representation:
The wave function in one dimension can be expressed as:
Ψ(x,t)=Aei(kx−ωt)\Psi(x, t) = A e^{i(kx - \omega t)}Ψ(x,t)=Aei(kx−ωt)
where:

Ψ(x,t)\Psi(x, t)Ψ(x,t) = Wave function
AAA = Amplitude of the wave
kkk = Wave number
ω\omegaω = Angular frequency
xxx = Position
ttt = Time


Physical Interpretation:
The square of the wave function’s magnitude represents the probability density of finding a particle at a particular position and time:
∣Ψ(x,t)∣2=Ψ∗(x,t)Ψ(x,t)|\Psi(x, t)|^2 = \Psi^*(x, t) \Psi(x, t)∣Ψ(x,t)∣2=Ψ∗(x,t)Ψ(x,t)
where:

∣Ψ(x,t)∣2|\Psi(x, t)|^2∣Ψ(x,t)∣2 = Probability density
Ψ∗(x,t)\Psi^*(x, t)Ψ∗(x,t) = Complex conjugate of the wave function


📝 NOTE: The wave function itself does not represent a physical quantity but helps calculate probabilities.


Conditions for a Valid Wave Function:
A wave function must satisfy the following conditions to be physically meaningful:


Normalization Condition:

The total probability must be 1:
∫−∞∞∣Ψ(x,t)∣2 dx=1\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\Psi(x, t)|^2 \, dx = 1∫−∞∞​∣Ψ(x,t)∣2dx=1



Single-Valued:

The wave function must have a single value at every point.



Continuous and Differentiable:

The wave function and its derivative should be continuous and differentiable to ensure valid physical predictions.



Finite:

The wave function must be finite across all space.




Types of Wave Functions:


Stationary Wave Function:

Time-independent, often for bound states.
Ψ(x)\Psi(x)Ψ(x) depends only on position.



Time-Dependent Wave Function:

Includes both position and time variations.




Schrödinger’s Wave Equation:
The wave function satisfies the Schrödinger equation, which governs the behavior of quantum particles:
Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation:
iℏ∂Ψ∂t=−ℏ22m∂2Ψ∂x2+V(x)Ψi\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + V(x)\Psiiℏ∂t∂Ψ​=−2mℏ2​∂x2∂2Ψ​+V(x)Ψ
where:

ℏ\hbarℏ = Reduced Planck’s constant
mmm = Mass of the particle
V(x)V(x)V(x) = Potential energy

Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation:
−ℏ22md2Ψdx2+V(x)Ψ=EΨ-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \Psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\Psi = E\Psi−2mℏ2​dx2d2Ψ​+V(x)Ψ=EΨ

Probability Interpretation:

The wave function describes a probability distribution.
The probability of finding a particle between xxx and x+dxx + dxx+dx is given by:

P(x)=∣Ψ(x)∣2dxP(x) = |\Psi(x)|^2 dxP(x)=∣Ψ(x)∣2dx

Normalization Example:
If a wave function is Ψ(x)=Ae−x2\Psi(x) = A e^{-x^2}Ψ(x)=Ae−x2, the normalization constant can be found using:
∫−∞∞∣Ae−x2∣2 dx=1\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |A e^{-x^2}|^2 \, dx = 1∫−∞∞​∣Ae−x2∣2dx=1

💡 TIP: Proper normalization ensures the total probability equals 1.


Physical Significance of the Wave Function:

Describes Quantum States: Represents all information about a quantum system.
Non-Deterministic Nature: Predicts probability instead of definite outcomes.
Superposition Principle: Multiple wave functions can add together to form new valid states.


Key Concepts:

Collapse of the Wave Function: Upon measurement, the wave function collapses to a definite state.
Born Interpretation: The square of the wave function gives the probability density.
Quantum Tunneling: The wave function can penetrate through energy barriers.


📝 NOTE: The wave function is fundamental in quantum mechanics and forms the basis for predicting outcomes in the microscopic world.


Conclusion:

The wave function is central to quantum mechanics and describes the probabilistic nature of particles.
It provides a complete description of a quantum system and is governed by the Schrödinger equation.


Schrödinger’s Time-Dependent and Time-Independent Wave Equation
Introduction:
The Schrödinger wave equation is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics formulated by Erwin Schrödinger in 1926. It describes how the quantum state (wave function) of a particle evolves over time and space.

1. Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE)
The time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) describes the behavior of a quantum particle where both time and space variations are considered. It governs the dynamics of a quantum system.
Mathematical Form:
iℏ∂Ψ(x,t)∂t=−ℏ22m∂2Ψ(x,t)∂x2+V(x)Ψ(x,t)i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x, t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \Psi(x, t)iℏ∂t∂Ψ(x,t)​=−2mℏ2​∂x2∂2Ψ(x,t)​+V(x)Ψ(x,t)
where:

Ψ(x,t)\Psi(x, t)Ψ(x,t) = Wave function (depends on position and time)
ℏ\hbarℏ = Reduced Planck’s constant (ℏ=h2π)(\hbar = \frac{h}{2\pi})(ℏ=2πh​)
mmm = Mass of the particle
V(x)V(x)V(x) = Potential energy
iii = Imaginary unit


Key Concepts:

Quantum Evolution: Describes how the quantum state evolves over time.
Wave Function: The solution Ψ(x,t)\Psi(x, t)Ψ(x,t) provides complete information about the quantum system.
Probabilistic Nature: The square of the wave function gives the probability density.


Physical Significance:

Governs dynamic behavior of particles in quantum mechanics.
Used for studying quantum dynamics, such as tunneling and interference patterns.


General Solution (for a free particle):
Ψ(x,t)=Aei(kx−ωt)\Psi(x, t) = A e^{i(kx - \omega t)}Ψ(x,t)=Aei(kx−ωt)
where:

k=2πλk = \frac{2\pi}{\lambda}k=λ2π​ (Wave number)
ω=Eℏ\omega = \frac{E}{\hbar}ω=ℏE​ (Angular frequency)


2. Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE)
The time-independent Schrödinger equation (TISE) is derived from the TDSE when the potential energy V(x)V(x)V(x) is time-independent. It describes stationary states where the probability distribution does not change with time.
Mathematical Form:
−ℏ22md2Ψ(x)dx2+V(x)Ψ(x)=EΨ(x)-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \Psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x) \Psi(x) = E\Psi(x)−2mℏ2​dx2d2Ψ(x)​+V(x)Ψ(x)=EΨ(x)
where:

EEE = Total energy of the particle (a constant for stationary states)
Ψ(x)\Psi(x)Ψ(x) = Wave function dependent only on position
The equation describes the particle’s spatial behavior in a static potential.


Key Concepts:

Stationary States: Describes systems where the probability distribution remains constant over time.
Eigenvalue Problem: The solutions give quantized energy levels.
Eigenfunctions: The wave functions Ψ(x)\Psi(x)Ψ(x).


Separation of Variables (Derivation from TDSE):
Starting with the TDSE:
iℏ∂Ψ(x,t)∂t=−ℏ22m∂2Ψ(x,t)∂x2+V(x)Ψ(x,t)i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2 \Psi(x, t)}{\partial x^2} + V(x) \Psi(x, t)iℏ∂t∂Ψ(x,t)​=−2mℏ2​∂x2∂2Ψ(x,t)​+V(x)Ψ(x,t)
Assume the wave function can be separated into space and time components:
Ψ(x,t)=ψ(x)ϕ(t)\Psi(x, t) = \psi(x)\phi(t)Ψ(x,t)=ψ(x)ϕ(t)
Plugging into TDSE and simplifying gives:


Time component:
iℏdϕdt=Eϕi\hbar \frac{d\phi}{dt} = E\phiiℏdtdϕ​=Eϕ


Spatial component (TISE):
−ℏ22md2ψdx2+V(x)ψ=Eψ-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \psi}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi = E\psi−2mℏ2​dx2d2ψ​+V(x)ψ=Eψ



Physical Significance:

Energy Quantization: Solving the TISE provides discrete energy levels for bound systems (like electrons in an atom).
Stationary States: Particles in stationary states do not evolve in time except for a phase factor.

Quantum computing


Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation:

Quantum harmonic oscillator
Particle in a box
Hydrogen atom model





📝 NOTE: The TISE is often used for systems in equilibrium, while the TDSE is essential for understanding dynamic quantum phenomena.


Conclusion:

The Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE) describes how quantum systems evolve over time.
The Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation (TISE) describes stationary states with constant energy.
Both equations are essential for understanding quantum mechanics and provide deep insights into the behavior of particles at microscopic scales.


Particle in a Box Problem
Introduction:
The Particle in a Box is a fundamental problem in quantum mechanics used to illustrate the principles of quantization and wave functions. It describes a particle that is free to move in a region of space (a “box”) but is confined by infinitely high potential walls outside this region.

Assumptions:

The particle is confined to a one-dimensional box with perfectly rigid walls.
The potential energy V(x)V(x)V(x) inside the box is zero (V(x)=0V(x) = 0V(x)=0 for 0≤x≤L0 \leq x \leq L0≤x≤L).
The potential energy outside the box is infinite (V(x)=∞V(x) = \inftyV(x)=∞ for x<0x < 0x<0 or x>Lx > Lx>L).
The particle cannot escape the box due to the infinite potential outside.


Schrödinger Equation:
The time-independent Schrödinger equation for the particle inside the box is:
−ℏ22md2Ψ(x)dx2=EΨ(x)-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{d^2 \Psi(x)}{dx^2} = E \Psi(x)−2mℏ2​dx2d2Ψ(x)​=EΨ(x)
where:

ℏ\hbarℏ = Reduced Planck’s constant
mmm = Mass of the particle
EEE = Energy of the particle
Ψ(x)\Psi(x)Ψ(x) = Wave function


Boundary Conditions:

Ψ(0)=0\Psi(0) = 0Ψ(0)=0 (The wave function must vanish at x=0x = 0x=0).
Ψ(L)=0\Psi(L) = 0Ψ(L)=0 (The wave function must vanish at x=Lx = Lx=L).

These conditions arise because the particle cannot exist outside the box, where the potential is infinite.

Solution:
The general solution for the wave function inside the box is:
Ψ(x)=Asin⁡(kx)+Bcos⁡(kx)\Psi(x) = A \sin(kx) + B \cos(kx)Ψ(x)=Asin(kx)+Bcos(kx)
Applying the boundary conditions:

At x=0x = 0x=0: Ψ(0)=B=0\Psi(0) = B = 0Ψ(0)=B=0.
Thus, Ψ(x)=Asin⁡(kx)\Psi(x) = A \sin(kx)Ψ(x)=Asin(kx).
At x=Lx = Lx=L: Ψ(L)=Asin⁡(kL)=0\Psi(L) = A \sin(kL) = 0Ψ(L)=Asin(kL)=0.

For A≠0A \neq 0A=0, sin⁡(kL)=0\sin(kL) = 0sin(kL)=0, which gives:
kL=nπ(n=1,2,3,… )kL = n\pi \quad (n = 1, 2, 3, \dots)kL=nπ(n=1,2,3,…)
Thus, kkk is quantized as:
k=nπLk = \frac{n\pi}{L}k=Lnπ​

Quantized Energy Levels:
The energy EEE of the particle is related to kkk by:
E=ℏ2k22mE = \frac{\hbar^2 k^2}{2m}E=2mℏ2k2​
Substituting k=nπLk = \frac{n\pi}{L}k=Lnπ​:
En=n2π2ℏ22mL2(n=1,2,3,… )E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2} \quad (n = 1, 2, 3, \dots)En​=2mL2n2π2ℏ2​(n=1,2,3,…)
where nnn is the quantum number that determines the energy level.

Wave Function:
The normalized wave function for the particle is:
Ψn(x)=2Lsin⁡(nπxL)\Psi_n(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)Ψn​(x)=L2​​sin(Lnπx​)
where n=1,2,3,…n = 1, 2, 3, \dotsn=1,2,3,….

Key Features:

Quantization: The energy of the particle is quantized, meaning it can only take discrete values EnE_nEn​.
Wave Function Nodes: For the nnn-th state, there are n−1n - 1n−1 nodes (points where Ψ(x)=0\Psi(x) = 0Ψ(x)=0 inside the box).
Ground State: The lowest energy level (n=1n = 1n=1) is:
E1=π2ℏ22mL2E_1 = \frac{\pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}E1​=2mL2π2ℏ2​
Higher Energy States: Higher quantum numbers correspond to higher energy levels and more complex wave functions.


Probability Density:
The probability density is given by:
∣Ψn(x)∣2=2Lsin⁡2(nπxL)|\Psi_n(x)|^2 = \frac{2}{L} \sin^2\left(\frac{n\pi x}{L}\right)∣Ψn​(x)∣2=L2​sin2(Lnπx​)

The probability of finding the particle is highest where the wave function has peaks.
The particle is least likely to be found at the nodes (∣Ψ(x)∣2=0|\Psi(x)|^2 = 0∣Ψ(x)∣2=0).


Applications:

Quantum Confinement: Understanding electrons in nanostructures like quantum dots.
Spectroscopy: Explains discrete energy levels in atoms and molecules.
Foundation of Quantum Mechanics: Demonstrates the principles of quantization and wave behavior.



📝 NOTE: The particle in a box model is an idealized system, but it effectively illustrates fundamental quantum mechanics principles.


Conclusion:
The Particle in a Box problem is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics that demonstrates how confinement leads to quantized energy levels and wave functions. It provides critical insights into the behaviour of particles in quantum systems.
