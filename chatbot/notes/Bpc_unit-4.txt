Notes for Unit 4: Arrays, Strings, and Structures in C

1. Single and Multidimensional Arrays
Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, and they can be classified as single-dimensional (1D) or multidimensional (2D, 3D, etc.).
Array Declaration and Initialization:


1D Array Declaration:
type array_name[size];
Example:
int arr[5];  // Declares an array of 5 integers


1D Array Initialization:
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};


2D Array Declaration:
type array_name[rows][columns];
Example:
int arr[3][4];  // Declares a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns


2D Array Initialization:
int arr[2][3] = {{1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}};


Arrays as Function Arguments:
Arrays can be passed to functions as arguments. When an array is passed, it is passed by reference (i.e., the function works directly with the original array).

Example:
void printArray(int arr[], int size) {
    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
        printf("%d ", arr[i]);
    }
}
 
int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
    printArray(arr, 4);  // Passing array to function
    return 0;
}



2. Strings in C
Strings are arrays of characters in C, terminated by a null character ('\0').
String Initialization:


Using Character Arrays:
char str[20];  // Declares a string of 20 characters


Using String Literals:
char str[] = "Hello";  // Initializes a string with "Hello"


String Handling Functions:


strlen() - Returns the length of a string (excluding the null character).
int len = strlen(str);


strcpy() - Copies one string to another.
strcpy(dest, source);


strcat() - Concatenates two strings.
strcat(str1, str2);


strcmp() - Compares two strings.
int result = strcmp(str1, str2);


strchr() - Finds the first occurrence of a character in a string.
char *ptr = strchr(str, 'a');


strstr() - Finds the first occurrence of a substring in a string.
char *ptr = strstr(str, "sub");



3. Structures in C basics
A structure is a user-defined data type that allows grouping variables of different data types.
Structure Definition and Declaration:


Syntax:
struct structure_name {
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    // More members
};


Example:
struct Student {
    int roll_no;
    char name[50];
};


Structure Declaration:
struct Student student1;


Nested Structures:
Structures can contain other structures as members, known as nested structures.

Example:
struct Address {
    char city[50];
    char state[50];
};
 
struct Employee {
    int emp_id;
    struct Address address;  // Nested structure
};


Array of Structures:
An array of structures allows storing multiple records of the same type.

Example:
struct Student students[5];  // Array of 5 student structures


Structure as Function Arguments:
Structures can be passed to functions as arguments, either by value or by reference (using pointers).


Passing by Value:
void printStudent(struct Student s) {
    printf("%d %s", s.roll_no, s.name);
}


Passing by Reference (Pointer):
void modifyStudent(struct Student *s) {
    s->roll_no = 10;  // Modifying the structure using pointer
}


Function that Returns a Structure:
Functions can return structures, allowing you to return multiple values at once.

Example:
struct Student getStudent() {
    struct Student s = {1, "John"};
    return s;
}



4. Union in C
A union is similar to a structure but with a key difference: all members of a union share the same memory location. Only one member can hold a value at any given time.
Union Definition and Declaration:


Syntax:
union union_name {
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    // More members
};


Example:
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};


Accessing Union Members:
union Data data;
data.i = 10;  // Assigning value to the 'i' member



Important Points:

Memory Allocation: Structures and arrays are statically allocated, meaning their size is fixed at compile time. Unions, on the other hand, share memory among their members.
Use of Unions: Unions are useful when you need to store different data types but only one at a time, saving memory.
String Handling: Always ensure that strings are properly null-terminated to avoid unexpected behavior.


ðŸ’¡ TIP: Structures and unions are powerful tools for organizing complex data in C. Use structures when you need to store related data of different types, and use unions when you need to store different types of data but only one at a time.

Hereâ€™s an explanation of the Structure and Union topics, covering the requested subtopics with examples:

Structure in C Advanced somehow
Why Use Structures?
A structure is used to group related data of different types into a single unit. It is particularly useful for:

Representing complex data, such as records (e.g., student information, employee details).
Organizing and managing data efficiently.
Enhancing code readability and maintainability.


Declaration of a Structure
A structure is defined using the struct keyword.
Syntax:
struct StructureName {
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    // More members
};
Example:
struct Student {
    int roll_no;
    char name[50];
    float marks;
};

Accessing Structure Elements
Structure elements are accessed using the dot operator (.).
Example:
struct Student s1;
s1.roll_no = 101;
strcpy(s1.name, "Alice");
s1.marks = 95.5;
 
printf("Roll No: %d\n", s1.roll_no);
printf("Name: %s\n", s1.name);
printf("Marks: %.2f\n", s1.marks);

How Structure Elements Are Stored

Each member of a structure is stored in contiguous memory locations.
The total memory allocated to a structure is the sum of the memory required by its members (considering padding for alignment).

Example:
struct Example {
    char a;    // 1 byte
    int b;     // 4 bytes
    char c;    // 1 byte
};
The memory allocated may include padding for alignment, e.g., 12 bytes instead of 6.

Array of Structures
An array of structures is used to store multiple records of the same type.
Example:
struct Student students[3];
 
students[0].roll_no = 101;
strcpy(students[0].name, "Alice");
students[0].marks = 95.5;
 
students[1].roll_no = 102;
strcpy(students[1].name, "Bob");
students[1].marks = 89.0;
 
printf("Name of Student 1: %s\n", students[0].name);

Uses of Structures

Data Representation: Efficiently represent real-world entities, such as employees, students, and products.
Code Organization: Group related variables for better readability and maintainability.
Nested Structures: Represent hierarchical data, such as an employeeâ€™s address within an employee record.


Union in C
Union Definition and Declaration
A union is similar to a structure but with a key difference: all members share the same memory location. This means only one member can hold a value at a time.
Syntax:
union UnionName {
    data_type member1;
    data_type member2;
    // More members
};
Example:
union Data {
    int i;
    float f;
    char str[20];
};

Accessing a Union Member
Union members are accessed using the dot operator (.).
Example:
union Data data;
 
data.i = 10;
printf("Integer: %d\n", data.i);
 
data.f = 3.14;
printf("Float: %.2f\n", data.f);

Union of Structures
A union can contain structures as members, allowing a combination of both.
Example:
struct Employee {
    int id;
    char name[50];
};
 
union Mixed {
    struct Employee emp;
    int value;
};

Initialization of Union Members
Only one member can be initialized at a time.
Example:
union Data data = {10};  // Initializes the first member (int i)
 
printf("Integer: %d\n", data.i);

Uses of Union

Memory Efficiency: Saves memory by reusing the same memory location for different members.
Hardware Interfacing: Useful in embedded systems for managing hardware registers.
Variant Data Types: Handle multiple data types in a single memory location.


Use of User-Defined Data Types
Structures and unions allow users to define their own data types for better data organization.
Example:
typedef struct {
    int roll_no;
    char name[50];
} Student;
 
Student s1 = {101, "Alice"};
printf("Roll No: %d, Name: %s\n", s1.roll_no, s1.name);
