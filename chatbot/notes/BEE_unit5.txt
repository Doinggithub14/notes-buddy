A single line diagram (SLD) for power generation to distribution typically includes the following key components in sequence:


Power Generation (Generating Station):

Power generation units (e.g., thermal, hydro, nuclear, solar, wind turbines)
Step-up transformer (to increase voltage for transmission)



Transmission Network:

High voltage transmission lines (e.g., 230 kV, 400 kV)
Transmission substations with circuit breakers and isolators
Step-down transformers (to reduce voltage for sub-transmission)



Sub-Transmission Network:

Medium voltage lines (e.g., 33 kV, 66 kV)
Distribution substations with step-down transformers



Distribution Network:

Primary distribution lines (e.g., 11 kV)
Distribution transformers (further reducing voltage to 400 V or 230 V)
Secondary distribution lines supplying electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial consumers



Key Symbols in the SLD:

Generator: A circle with a G inside
Transformer: Two parallel lines with winding notations
Busbar: Straight line representing connection points
Circuit Breaker: A simple break in the line with a square box
Transmission Lines: Simple straight lines

Here’s a block diagram representation of Hydro Power Plant and Thermal Power Plant:
Hydro Power Plant (Block Diagram)

Water Reservoir → Penstock → Turbine → Generator → Step-up Transformer → Transmission Line

Water Reservoir: Stores water at a height, providing potential energy.
Penstock: A pipeline that directs water from the reservoir to the turbine.
Turbine: Converts kinetic energy of water into mechanical energy.
Generator: Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
Step-up Transformer: Increases voltage for efficient transmission.
Transmission Line: Transfers electricity to the grid.


Thermal Power Plant (Block Diagram)

Coal Storage → Boiler → Turbine → Generator → Step-up Transformer → Transmission Line

Coal Storage: Coal is stored for use as fuel.
Boiler: Burns coal to produce steam from water.
Turbine: Steam rotates the turbine, converting thermal energy into mechanical energy.
Generator: Converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
Step-up Transformer: Increases voltage for transmission efficiency.
Transmission Line: Transfers electricity to the grid.

Electrical Installation Components and Concepts
1. Fuse:

Purpose: Protects circuits from overcurrent by melting and breaking the circuit when current exceeds a safe level.
Types:

Rewirable Fuse
Cartridge Fuse
HRC (High Rupturing Capacity) Fuse
Drop-out Fuse




2. MCB (Miniature Circuit Breaker):

Purpose: Automatically switches off the circuit during overload or short circuit conditions.
Advantages over Fuse:

Reusable
More reliable and faster operation


Types:

Single Pole (SP)
Double Pole (DP)
Triple Pole (TP)
Four Pole (FP)




3. Types of Wires and Cables:

Single Core Wire: Used in domestic wiring.
Twin Core Wire: Used for lighting circuits.
Three Core Wire: Used in three-phase circuits.
Coaxial Cable: Used for TV signal transmission.
Shielded Cable: Used in sensitive electronic circuits.
Armoured Cable: Used for underground wiring for protection.


4. Earthing (Grounding):

Purpose: Prevent electric shock and protect equipment by providing a path for leakage current.
Types:

Plate Earthing
Pipe Earthing
Rod Earthing


Components: Earthing rod/plate, Earthing wire, Moist soil.


5. Energy Billing – Sample Calculation:
Formula:
Energy Consumed (kWh)=Power (kW)×Time (hours)\text{Energy Consumed (kWh)} = \text{Power (kW)} \times \text{Time (hours)}Energy Consumed (kWh)=Power (kW)×Time (hours)
Example:

Appliance Power: 1.5 kW
Usage: 5 hours/day
Days: 30 days
Tariff Rate: $0.12 per kWh

Energy Consumed:
1.5×5×30=225 kWh1.5 \times 5 \times 30 = 225 \text{ kWh}1.5×5×30=225 kWh
Energy Cost:
225×0.12=$27225 \times 0.12 = \$27225×0.12=$27
