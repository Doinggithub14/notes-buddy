## Introduction to Fourier Series

The **Fourier Series** is a powerful mathematical tool used to express a function as the sum of sinusoidal functions (sines and cosines). It decomposes periodic functions into a series of simpler sine and cosine waves, making it easier to analyze and understand the properties of the function, especially in signal processing, physics, and engineering.

### What is a Fourier Series?
A **Fourier Series** allows us to represent a periodic function $$ f(t) $$ (with period $$ T $$) as an infinite sum of sines and cosines. The general form of the Fourier Series is:

$$
f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) + b_n \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \right)
$$

Where:
- $$ a_0 $$ is the average (or DC) term.
- $$ a_n $$ and $$ b_n $$ are the Fourier coefficients that determine the amplitude of the cosine and sine terms.
- $$ n $$ is a positive integer indicating the harmonic number.
- $$ T $$ is the period of the function.

The Fourier Series expresses the periodic function as a sum of sinusoidal components, each with a different frequency, amplitude, and phase.

---

### Fourier Coefficients

To find the Fourier Series representation of a function, we first need to compute the Fourier coefficients. For a periodic function $$ f(t) $$ with period $$ T $$, the Fourier coefficients are computed as follows:

#### 1. **DC (Average) Term $$ a_0 $$:**

The average or constant term $$ a_0 $$ is given by:

$$
a_0 = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \, dt
$$

#### 2. **Cosine Coefficients $$ a_n $$:**

The Fourier coefficients for the cosine terms $$ a_n $$ are:

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

#### 3. **Sine Coefficients $$ b_n $$:**

The Fourier coefficients for the sine terms $$ b_n $$ are:

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

These integrals are used to compute the specific values of the coefficients for the sine and cosine terms in the Fourier Series.

### Conditions for Fourier Series

For a function to have a Fourier Series representation, it must satisfy certain conditions. The most commonly known condition is that the function should be **piecewise continuous** and **periodic**.

- **Piecewise Continuity**: The function must be continuous, with only a finite number of discontinuities (i.e., jump discontinuities) over one period.
- **Periodic**: The function must repeat itself after a certain interval (i.e., the function must have a period $$ T $$).

---

### Applications of Fourier Series

The Fourier Series is used in a wide range of applications, including:

1. **Signal Processing**:
   - Fourier Series is fundamental in analyzing and synthesizing signals. It helps convert signals into their frequency components.
   - It is used in **audio** and **image compression** (like MP3 and JPEG formats).

2. **Electrical Engineering**:
   - Fourier Series is used to analyze alternating current (AC) circuits and systems, where signals are periodic.

3. **Vibrations and Waves**:
   - Fourier Series is useful in the study of vibrating strings, sound waves, and other waveforms in physics.

4. **Heat Equation and Differential Equations**:
   - Fourier Series is used to solve partial differential equations (such as the heat equation) that describe the distribution of heat in a given region over time.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- Fourier Series provides insight into the **frequency domain** of a periodic signal, allowing us to analyze the components of the signal at various frequencies.

---
## Fourier Series for Discontinuous Functions

In real-world applications, many functions are not smooth and may have discontinuities. The Fourier Series can still be applied to these functions, but we need to account for the fact that the series might not converge to the function at the points of discontinuity.

### Fourier Series and Discontinuities
For **discontinuous functions**, the Fourier Series provides an approximation that matches the function **almost everywhere** except at the discontinuities. At the points of discontinuity, the Fourier Series converges to the **average of the left-hand and right-hand limits** of the function.

### Dirichlet's Conditions
To apply the Fourier Series to a function (whether continuous or discontinuous), the function must satisfy **Dirichlet's conditions**. These conditions are:
1. The function must be periodic.
2. The function must be **piecewise** continuous.
3. The function must have **finitely many discontinuities** in one period.
4. The function must have **finitely many extrema** (i.e., no infinite oscillations).

Even if a function has discontinuities, it can still have a Fourier Series if it satisfies these conditions.

### Fourier Series of a Discontinuous Function

Given a function $$ f(t) $$ that is periodic with period $$ T $$, the Fourier Series is generally expressed as:

$$
f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \left( a_n \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) + b_n \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \right)
$$

Where:
- $$ a_0, a_n, b_n $$ are the Fourier coefficients.
- The Fourier coefficients are given by:

$$
a_0 = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \, dt
$$

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

### Handling Discontinuities

When the function $$ f(t) $$ has a **discontinuity** at a point (say at $$ t = t_0 $$), the Fourier Series will not exactly match the function at that point. Instead, it will converge to the **average of the left-hand and right-hand limits** of the function at the discontinuity.

Letâ€™s define the limits:
- $$ f(t_0^-) $$ is the value of the function just before the discontinuity.
- $$ f(t_0^+) $$ is the value of the function just after the discontinuity.

The Fourier Series will **converge to the average of these two values** at the point of discontinuity:

$$
f(t_0) = \frac{f(t_0^+) + f(t_0^-)}{2}
$$

This is known as the **Gibbs phenomenon**, which states that the Fourier Series at a jump discontinuity oscillates around the discontinuity and approaches the average of the two values at that point.

### Example: Fourier Series for a Discontinuous Function

Letâ€™s consider a simple example where the function is discontinuous.

### Example: Step Function (Piecewise Function)

Consider a **piecewise constant function** $$ f(t) $$ with a period $$ T $$:

$$
f(t) =
\begin{cases}
1, & 0 \leq t < \frac{T}{2} \\
-1, & \frac{T}{2} \leq t < T
\end{cases}
$$

This function has a discontinuity at $$ t = \frac{T}{2} $$.

### Step 1: Fourier Coefficients

1. **Compute the average term $$ a_0 $$:**

$$
a_0 = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \, dt = \frac{2}{T} \left( \int_0^{T/2} 1 \, dt + \int_{T/2}^T (-1) \, dt \right)
$$

$$
a_0 = \frac{2}{T} \left( \frac{T}{2} - \frac{T}{2} \right) = 0
$$

2. **Compute the cosine coefficients $$ a_n $$:**

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

Split the integral at the discontinuity:

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{T} \left( \int_0^{T/2} \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt - \int_{T/2}^T \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt \right)
$$

3. **Compute the sine coefficients $$ b_n $$:**

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

Again, split the integral at the discontinuity:

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{T} \left( \int_0^{T/2} \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt - \int_{T/2}^T \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt \right)
$$

### Step 2: Fourier Series Representation

Once the coefficients are computed, you can reconstruct the Fourier Series of the discontinuous function. For a discontinuous function like this, the series will **oscillate around** the discontinuity at $$ t = T/2 $$, converging to the average of the two values, i.e., the **step value**.

### Gibbs Phenomenon

The **Gibbs Phenomenon** refers to the oscillations that occur near a discontinuity in the Fourier Series. The Fourier Series will overshoot the discontinuity by about **9%** of the jump at the discontinuity.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- The Fourier Series provides a good approximation for discontinuous functions, especially when you are interested in the frequency content of the function or analyzing signals that involve sudden changes or "steps".
- The Fourier Series will **never converge exactly at the points of discontinuity** but instead converge to the **average of the limits**.

---
## Fourier Series for Even and Odd Functions

### Even Function:
A function $$ f(t) $$ is called **even** if it satisfies the condition:

$$
f(t) = f(-t)
$$

For even functions, the graph of the function is symmetrical about the vertical axis, i.e., it has reflection symmetry.

### Odd Function:
A function $$ f(t) $$ is called **odd** if it satisfies the condition:

$$
f(t) = -f(-t)
$$

For odd functions, the graph of the function has rotational symmetry about the origin.

---

### Fourier Series for Even Functions

If a function is **even**, the Fourier Series representation can be simplified significantly because all the **sine terms** (which are odd functions) will have zero coefficients, and only the **cosine terms** (which are even functions) will remain.

#### Fourier Series for an Even Function:

For a general even function with period $$ T $$, the Fourier Series will contain only the **cosine terms** and the average term. The Fourier Series for an even function is:

$$
f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right)
$$

Where the Fourier coefficients are:

- **Average term** (DC term):

$$
a_0 = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \, dt
$$

- **Cosine coefficients**:

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

Since the function is even, the sine coefficients $$ b_n $$ will be **zero**, as the sine function is odd and will cancel out when integrated over the symmetric interval.

#### Key Points for Even Functions:
- **Only cosine terms** (and the constant term) appear in the Fourier Series.
- The function is symmetric about the vertical axis.

---

### Fourier Series for Odd Functions

If a function is **odd**, the Fourier Series representation will only contain **sine terms** because the cosine terms will have zero coefficients due to the symmetry of the function.

#### Fourier Series for an Odd Function:

For a general odd function with period $$ T $$, the Fourier Series will contain only the **sine terms**. The Fourier Series for an odd function is:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right)
$$

Where the Fourier coefficients are:

- **Sine coefficients**:

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

- The average term $$ a_0 $$ and the cosine coefficients $$ a_n $$ will be **zero** for an odd function, as the function is symmetric about the origin.

#### Key Points for Odd Functions:
- **Only sine terms** appear in the Fourier Series.
- The function is symmetric about the origin.

---

### Example 1: Fourier Series for an Even Function

Consider the following even function:

$$
f(t) =
\begin{cases}
1, & 0 \leq t < \frac{T}{2} \\
1, & \frac{T}{2} \leq t < T
\end{cases}
$$

This is a **constant** function, which is trivially even.

#### Step 1: Compute the Fourier Coefficients

- **Average term** (since the function is constant):

$$
a_0 = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T 1 \, dt = \frac{2}{T} \cdot T = 2
$$

- **Cosine coefficients**:

Since the function is constant, all **cosine terms** will be zero because:

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T 1 \cdot \cos\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt = 0 \quad \text{(for all n)}
$$

#### Fourier Series Representation:
The Fourier Series for this function would just be the **average term**:

$$
f(t) = 2
$$

---

### Example 2: Fourier Series for an Odd Function

Consider the following odd function:

$$
f(t) =
\begin{cases}
t, & 0 \leq t < \frac{T}{2} \\
-T + t, & \frac{T}{2} \leq t < T
\end{cases}
$$

This function is odd because $$ f(t) = -f(-t) $$.

#### Step 1: Compute the Fourier Coefficients

- **Average term** (for odd functions, $$ a_0 = 0 $$):

$$
a_0 = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \, dt = 0 \quad \text{(since the function is odd and symmetric about the origin)}
$$

- **Sine coefficients** (since the function is odd):

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{T} \int_0^T f(t) \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right) \, dt
$$

Only **sine terms** contribute for an odd function. You can compute these integrals by dividing the function into its respective intervals and applying integration by parts or using known Fourier sine integrals.

#### Fourier Series Representation:
For this odd function, the Fourier Series will contain only **sine terms**:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n \sin\left( \frac{2 \pi n t}{T} \right)
$$

Where the coefficients $$ b_n $$ are calculated using the integral formula.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- For **even functions**, the Fourier Series contains only **cosine terms** (and possibly the constant term).
- For **odd functions**, the Fourier Series contains only **sine terms**.

This property can be used to simplify the computation of the Fourier Series, as we can directly eliminate terms based on the symmetry of the function.

## Half-Range Fourier Series

In many practical applications, we encounter functions that are not defined over a full period but only over a **half-period** or some **subset** of the domain. The **Half-Range Fourier Series** is used to represent such functions, and it can be broken into two types:

1. **Half-Range Sine Series**
2. **Half-Range Cosine Series**

These series are derived under the assumption that the function is **odd** or **even** over the given range.

---

### 1. **Half-Range Sine Series**

The **Half-Range Sine Series** is used when the function is defined over a **half-period** and is assumed to be **odd** (i.e., the function is symmetric about the origin and extends as an odd function beyond the given range).

#### Assumptions:
- The function $$ f(t) $$ is defined on the interval $$ 0 \leq t \leq L $$.
- We assume that $$ f(t) $$ is **odd** about $$ t = 0 $$, i.e., $$ f(t) = -f(-t) $$.
- The function is extended to the interval $$ -L \leq t \leq L $$ as an **odd function**.

#### Fourier Sine Series:

For a function $$ f(t) $$ defined on $$ [0, L] $$, the **Half-Range Sine Fourier Series** is given by:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n \sin\left( \frac{n \pi t}{L} \right)
$$

Where the Fourier sine coefficients $$ b_n $$ are calculated by:

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_0^L f(t) \sin\left( \frac{n \pi t}{L} \right) \, dt
$$

#### Key Points for Half-Range Sine Series:
- The function is extended as an **odd** function for the negative part of the interval.
- The Fourier Series contains **only sine terms**.
- The function is defined only on the interval $$ 0 \leq t \leq L $$.

---

### 2. **Half-Range Cosine Series**

The **Half-Range Cosine Series** is used when the function is defined over a **half-period** and is assumed to be **even** (i.e., the function is symmetric about the vertical axis and extends as an even function beyond the given range).

#### Assumptions:
- The function $$ f(t) $$ is defined on the interval $$ 0 \leq t \leq L $$.
- We assume that $$ f(t) $$ is **even** about $$ t = 0 $$, i.e., $$ f(t) = f(-t) $$.
- The function is extended to the interval $$ -L \leq t \leq L $$ as an **even function**.

#### Fourier Cosine Series:

For a function $$ f(t) $$ defined on $$ [0, L] $$, the **Half-Range Cosine Fourier Series** is given by:

$$
f(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n \cos\left( \frac{n \pi t}{L} \right)
$$

Where the Fourier cosine coefficients $$ a_n $$ are calculated by:

$$
a_0 = \frac{2}{L} \int_0^L f(t) \, dt
$$

$$
a_n = \frac{2}{L} \int_0^L f(t) \cos\left( \frac{n \pi t}{L} \right) \, dt \quad \text{for} \ n \geq 1
$$

#### Key Points for Half-Range Cosine Series:
- The function is extended as an **even** function for the negative part of the interval.
- The Fourier Series contains **only cosine terms** (and possibly the constant term).
- The function is defined only on the interval $$ 0 \leq t \leq L $$.

---

### Applications of Half-Range Fourier Series

The **Half-Range Fourier Series** is commonly used when dealing with:
- **Vibrations** in mechanical systems (where the displacement is often described by a half-range function).
- **Heat conduction problems** where the function is defined over half the length of a rod or plate.
- **Signal processing** where certain signals are naturally defined over half of their period, and we are interested in approximating them with sine or cosine series.

---

### Example: Half-Range Sine Series

Letâ€™s consider a simple example where the function is defined on the interval $$ [0, \pi] $$ and extended as an odd function:

$$
f(t) =
\begin{cases}
t, & 0 \leq t \leq \pi \\
-t, & -\pi \leq t < 0
\end{cases}
$$

We are asked to find the **Half-Range Sine Series** for this function.

#### Step 1: Fourier Sine Coefficients

Since the function is odd, it is naturally extended as an odd function. Now, we compute the Fourier sine coefficients $$ b_n $$:

$$
b_n = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\pi t \sin\left( n t \right) \, dt
$$

This is a standard integration problem, and solving it (using integration by parts or referring to standard integrals) will give us the required coefficients.

#### Step 2: Fourier Sine Series

After calculating the coefficients, the Fourier Sine Series will be:

$$
f(t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} b_n \sin(n t)
$$

Where $$ b_n $$ are the computed coefficients.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- Use the **Half-Range Sine Series** when the function is defined on a half-range and you want to represent it as an **odd function**.
- Use the **Half-Range Cosine Series** when the function is defined on a half-range and you want to represent it as an **even function**.
- These series are particularly useful when dealing with **boundary value problems** where the function has natural symmetries (odd or even).

---
## Fourier Transform

The **Fourier Transform** is a powerful mathematical tool used to express a function as a sum of sinusoidal components, each with its own frequency. Unlike the Fourier Series, which applies to periodic functions, the Fourier Transform is used for **non-periodic functions**. It provides a way to analyze the frequency content of signals that are not periodic and can be used in many applications, such as signal processing, physics, and engineering.

### Fourier Transform Definition

The Fourier Transform of a function $$ f(t) $$, denoted as $$ F(\omega) $$, is defined by the integral:

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} \, dt
$$

Where:
- $$ \omega $$ is the angular frequency (often $$ \omega = 2\pi f $$, where $$ f $$ is the frequency in Hz).
- $$ f(t) $$ is the original function (in the time domain).
- $$ F(\omega) $$ is the **Fourier transform** of $$ f(t) $$ (in the frequency domain).
- The integral runs over the entire time range, from $$ -\infty $$ to $$ +\infty $$.

This transform decomposes $$ f(t) $$ into its **frequency components** by expressing it in terms of complex exponentials (which are combinations of sine and cosine functions).

### Inverse Fourier Transform

The **Inverse Fourier Transform** is used to convert a function from the frequency domain back to the time domain. It is given by the formula:

$$
f(t) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} F(\omega) e^{i \omega t} \, d\omega
$$

Where:
- $$ F(\omega) $$ is the Fourier transform of the function $$ f(t) $$.
- $$ f(t) $$ is the original function in the time domain.
- The factor $$ \frac{1}{2\pi} $$ is included to normalize the inverse transform.

### Relationship Between Fourier Series and Fourier Transform

The **Fourier Series** is used to represent periodic functions as a sum of sinusoidal functions. However, for non-periodic functions, the Fourier **transform** is used to express the function as a continuous sum (integral) of sinusoidal components.

- **Fourier Series** applies to periodic functions, resulting in a sum of sinusoids.
- **Fourier Transform** applies to non-periodic functions, resulting in a continuous spectrum of sinusoids.

---

### Properties of Fourier Transform

The Fourier Transform has several important properties that make it useful in various applications:

1. **Linearity**:
   - If $$ f_1(t) $$ and $$ f_2(t) $$ are functions, and $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ are constants, then:
   
   $$
   \mathcal{F}[a f_1(t) + b f_2(t)] = a F_1(\omega) + b F_2(\omega)
   $$

2. **Time Shift**:
   - If the function $$ f(t) $$ is shifted by $$ t_0 $$, then its Fourier transform is multiplied by a complex exponential:
   
   $$
   \mathcal{F}[f(t - t_0)] = F(\omega) e^{-i \omega t_0}
   $$

3. **Frequency Shift**:
   - If the frequency of the function is shifted, the Fourier transform is scaled by a complex exponential:
   
   $$
   \mathcal{F}[f(t) e^{i \omega_0 t}] = F(\omega - \omega_0)
   $$

4. **Scaling**:
   - If the function is scaled in the time domain, the Fourier transform will be scaled in the frequency domain:
   
   $$
   \mathcal{F}[f(at)] = \frac{1}{|a|} F\left( \frac{\omega}{a} \right)
   $$

5. **Duality**:
   - There is a symmetry between the time and frequency domains. The Fourier transform of $$ f(t) $$ gives $$ F(\omega) $$, and the Fourier transform of $$ F(\omega) $$ gives $$ f(-t) $$.
   
   $$
   \mathcal{F}[f(t)] = F(\omega) \quad \text{implies} \quad \mathcal{F}[F(\omega)] = 2\pi f(-t)
   $$

6. **Parseval's Theorem**:
   - The energy in the time domain is equal to the energy in the frequency domain:
   
   $$
   \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |f(t)|^2 \, dt = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |F(\omega)|^2 \, d\omega
   $$

---
### Fourier Transform of Common Functions

Here are the Fourier transforms of some common functions:

1. **Impulse Function (Dirac Delta Function)**:
   
   The Fourier transform of the Dirac delta function $$ \delta(t) $$ is a constant:

   $$
   \mathcal{F}[\delta(t)] = 1
   $$

2. **Step Function**:

   The Fourier transform of the Heaviside step function $$ u(t) $$ is:

   $$
   \mathcal{F}[u(t)] = \frac{1}{i \omega} + \pi \delta(\omega)
   $$

3. **Exponential Function**:

   The Fourier transform of $$ e^{-a t} $$ (where $$ a > 0 $$) is:

   $$
   \mathcal{F}[e^{-a t}] = \frac{1}{a + i \omega}
   $$

4. **Sine and Cosine Functions**:

   The Fourier transforms of sine and cosine functions are:

   $$
   \mathcal{F}[\cos(\omega_0 t)] = \pi [\delta(\omega - \omega_0) + \delta(\omega + \omega_0)]
   $$

   $$
   \mathcal{F}[\sin(\omega_0 t)] = i \pi [\delta(\omega - \omega_0) - \delta(\omega + \omega_0)]
   $$

---

### Example: Fourier Transform of a Gaussian Function

Consider the Gaussian function $$ f(t) = e^{-a t^2} $$ for $$ a > 0 $$.

To compute its Fourier transform:

$$
F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-a t^2} e^{-i \omega t} \, dt
$$

This is a standard Gaussian integral, and its result is:

$$
F(\omega) = \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}} e^{-\frac{\omega^2}{4a}}
$$

This result shows that the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function is also a Gaussian.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- The **Fourier Transform** is used to convert a function in the time domain to the frequency domain and is crucial in many fields such as signal processing, communications, and control systems.
- The **Inverse Fourier Transform** allows you to convert back to the time domain, recovering the original function from its frequency components.

## Sine and Cosine Transforms

The **Sine Transform** and **Cosine Transform** are integral transforms that, like the Fourier Transform, decompose a function into sinusoidal components. However, they are specialized for functions defined over a half-domain, typically $$ [0, \infty) $$.

### 1. **Sine Transform**

The **Sine Transform** is used for functions that are **odd** or for problems where the solution has natural odd symmetry. It is defined as:

### **Forward Sine Transform:**

Given a function $$ f(t) $$, the **Sine Transform** is defined by the integral:

$$
S[f(t)] = \mathcal{S}[f(t)] = \int_0^\infty f(t) \sin(k t) \, dt
$$

Where:
- $$ k $$ is the transform variable (which can also be considered as the frequency).
- The integral runs from $$ 0 $$ to $$ \infty $$, which is typical for functions defined only on this half-domain.
  
### **Inverse Sine Transform:**

The inverse sine transform is used to recover the original function $$ f(t) $$ from its sine transform $$ F(k) $$:

$$
f(t) = \mathcal{S}^{-1}[F(k)] = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\infty F(k) \sin(k t) \, dk
$$

Where:
- $$ F(k) $$ is the Fourier sine transform of $$ f(t) $$.
- The factor $$ \frac{2}{\pi} $$ normalizes the inverse transform.

#### Key Features:
- The sine transform is particularly useful for solving boundary value problems where the function is defined on a semi-infinite domain, such as heat conduction in a rod with one end held at a fixed temperature and the other end insulated.

#### Example: Sine Transform of a Function

Consider the function $$ f(t) = e^{-t} $$, for $$ t \geq 0 $$.

The forward sine transform is:

$$
F(k) = \int_0^\infty e^{-t} \sin(k t) \, dt
$$

This is a standard integral, and the result is:

$$
F(k) = \frac{k}{k^2 + 1}
$$

Thus, the sine transform of $$ f(t) = e^{-t} $$ is $$ F(k) = \frac{k}{k^2 + 1} $$.

---
### 2. **Cosine Transform**

The **Cosine Transform** is used for functions that are **even** or for problems with natural even symmetry. It is defined as:

### **Forward Cosine Transform:**

Given a function $$ f(t) $$, the **Cosine Transform** is:

$$
C[f(t)] = \mathcal{C}[f(t)] = \int_0^\infty f(t) \cos(k t) \, dt
$$

Where:
- $$ k $$ is the frequency or transform variable.
- The integral is evaluated over the interval $$ 0 $$ to $$ \infty $$.

### **Inverse Cosine Transform:**

The inverse cosine transform is used to recover the original function $$ f(t) $$ from its cosine transform $$ G(k) $$:

$$
f(t) = \mathcal{C}^{-1}[G(k)] = \frac{2}{\pi} \int_0^\infty G(k) \cos(k t) \, dk
$$

Where:
- $$ G(k) $$ is the Fourier cosine transform of $$ f(t) $$.
- The factor $$ \frac{2}{\pi} $$ is used to normalize the inverse transform.

#### Key Features:
- The cosine transform is particularly useful when solving boundary value problems for even functions or when the function is defined on a half-domain and has symmetry about the origin.

#### Example: Cosine Transform of a Function

Consider the function $$ f(t) = e^{-t} $$, for $$ t \geq 0 $$.

The forward cosine transform is:

$$
G(k) = \int_0^\infty e^{-t} \cos(k t) \, dt
$$

This is another standard integral, and its result is:

$$
G(k) = \frac{1}{k^2 + 1}
$$

Thus, the cosine transform of $$ f(t) = e^{-t} $$ is $$ G(k) = \frac{1}{k^2 + 1} $$.
