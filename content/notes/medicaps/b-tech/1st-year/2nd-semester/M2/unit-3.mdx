## Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

A **Partial Differential Equation (PDE)** is an equation that involves partial derivatives of a function of more than one independent variable. These equations describe the relationship between a function and its partial derivatives, and they arise in various fields, including physics, engineering, economics, and biology.

### Definition:

A **Partial Differential Equation (PDE)** is an equation that involves an unknown function $$ u(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) $$ and its partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables $$ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n $$.

In general, a PDE is expressed as:

$$
F\left( x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n, u, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x_2}, \dots, \frac{\partial^m u}{\partial x_1^m}, \dots, \frac{\partial^m u}{\partial x_n^m} \right) = 0
$$

Where:
- $$ u = u(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n) $$ is the unknown function (dependent variable).
- $$ x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n $$ are the independent variables.
- The equation involves **partial derivatives** of the unknown function $$ u $$ with respect to one or more of the independent variables.

### Example of a PDE:

The **heat equation** is a well-known example of a PDE that describes how heat diffuses through a given region over time:

$$
\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
$$

Where:
- $$ u(x,t) $$ represents the temperature at position $$ x $$ and time $$ t $$.
- $$ \alpha $$ is the thermal diffusivity constant.
- The equation involves the first partial derivative of $$ u $$ with respect to time $$ t $$ and the second partial derivative of $$ u $$ with respect to space $$ x $$.

---

### Classification of PDEs

PDEs are typically classified based on their **order**, **linearity**, and the number of independent variables involved.

#### 1. **Order of a PDE:**
   The order of a PDE is determined by the highest order of partial derivatives in the equation.
   - For example, the heat equation above is a second-order PDE because it involves the second partial derivative of $$ u(x,t) $$ with respect to $$ x $$.

#### 2. **Linearity of a PDE:**
   A PDE is classified as **linear** if the unknown function and its derivatives appear to the power of 1 (i.e., there are no terms like $$ u^2 $$ or $$ \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right)^2 $$). If the equation involves non-linear terms, it is a **nonlinear PDE**.

   - **Linear PDE:** 
     $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + a \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = 0 $$
   - **Nonlinear PDE:**
     $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0 $$

#### 3. **Types of PDEs based on the number of independent variables:**
   - **Elliptic PDEs**: No real characteristic curves exist. Example: Laplace's equation.
   - **Parabolic PDEs**: There is a time-dependent aspect. Example: Heat equation.
   - **Hyperbolic PDEs**: Characterized by wave-like solutions. Example: Wave equation.

---

### Common Examples of PDEs:

1. **Heat Equation (Parabolic PDE):**
   Describes how heat diffuses through a medium over time.
   $$
   \frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
   $$

2. **Wave Equation (Hyperbolic PDE):**
   Describes the propagation of waves, such as sound or light waves.
   $$
   \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
   $$

3. **Laplace's Equation (Elliptic PDE):**
   Describes the behavior of a function in a region where there are no sources or sinks (steady-state heat, electrostatics).
   $$
   \frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial y^2} = 0
   $$

4. **Poisson's Equation (Elliptic PDE):**
   A generalization of Laplace's equation, often used to describe electrostatic potential.
   $$
   \frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial y^2} = f(x,y)
   $$

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- **PDEs** are used to model a wide range of real-world phenomena in physics, engineering, and applied mathematics. They allow us to understand and predict the behavior of systems over time and space, including heat flow, wave propagation, fluid dynamics, and more.
- **Solving PDEs** often involves using specific methods such as **separation of variables**, **characteristic equations**, **Fourier transform**, or numerical methods like **finite difference** or **finite element methods**.

## Formulation of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

The **formulation** of partial differential equations (PDEs) involves deriving an equation that describes a physical phenomenon or a mathematical model based on certain principles and boundary conditions. In many cases, these principles come from physical laws, such as conservation of energy, mass, or momentum.

### Steps for Formulating a PDE

1. **Identify the Physical Problem**:  
   The first step is to recognize the problem you're trying to model. This could be related to heat flow, wave propagation, fluid dynamics, or other phenomena.

2. **Define the Dependent and Independent Variables**:  
   - The **dependent variable** is the unknown function that we need to solve for (e.g., temperature, displacement, concentration).
   - The **independent variables** are the variables with respect to which partial derivatives are taken (e.g., time $$ t $$, spatial coordinates $$ x, y, z $$).

3. **State the Governing Law**:  
   The governing law is usually a physical law, such as:
   - Conservation of mass,
   - Conservation of energy,
   - Newtonâ€™s law of motion,
   - Fourierâ€™s law of heat conduction,
   - etc.
   
   These laws relate the rate of change of some quantity with respect to time or space.

4. **Translate the Physical Law into Mathematical Form**:  
   Use the governing law to write an equation involving the dependent and independent variables. For example, using the conservation of energy might give rise to an equation involving heat conduction and temperature.

5. **Express the Mathematical Formulation as a PDE**:  
   Apply the principles of calculus, specifically **partial differentiation**, to express the relationship between the function and its derivatives with respect to the independent variables.

### Common Methods of Formulating PDEs

1. **Using Physical Principles:**
   PDEs can often be formulated by applying principles of physics to the system. Some of the most common principles used in the formulation of PDEs are:

   - **Conservation of Mass**: In fluid mechanics, this principle leads to the **continuity equation**.
   - **Conservation of Energy**: In thermodynamics, this principle leads to the **heat equation**.
   - **Newton's Second Law**: In mechanics, this principle leads to the **wave equation** for displacement.
   - **Fick's Law of Diffusion**: Leads to the diffusion equation.

2. **Application to Specific Problems:**

   Let's look at examples of some common problems and their corresponding PDE formulations:

---
### Example 1: **Heat Equation (Thermal Conduction)**

#### Physical Problem:
- We want to describe how temperature $$ u(x,t) $$ in a solid object changes over time due to heat conduction.

#### Step 1: Identify the Variables
- **Dependent variable**: Temperature $$ u(x,t) $$
- **Independent variables**: Position $$ x $$ and time $$ t $$

#### Step 2: Governing Law
- The **Fourier Law of Heat Conduction** states that the rate of change of temperature in a material is proportional to the second derivative of the temperature with respect to space. This law assumes the material is homogeneous.

#### Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- According to the law of conservation of energy, the heat flow into a small element is equal to the heat flow out of it. This leads to the heat conduction equation:

$$
\frac{\partial u(x,t)}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
$$

Where:
- $$ u(x,t) $$ is the temperature at position $$ x $$ and time $$ t $$.
- $$ \alpha $$ is the thermal diffusivity constant, which depends on the material.
- The term $$ \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2} $$ represents the spatial rate of change of temperature.

---
### Example 2: **Wave Equation (Vibration of a String)**

#### Physical Problem:
- We want to describe the displacement $$ u(x,t) $$ of a vibrating string, such as a guitar string, over time.

#### Step 1: Identify the Variables
- **Dependent variable**: Displacement $$ u(x,t) $$ of the string.
- **Independent variables**: Position $$ x $$ and time $$ t $$.

#### Step 2: Governing Law
- According to **Newton's Second Law** of motion, the force on an element of the string is proportional to the acceleration of that element. This is balanced by the tension in the string.

#### Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- For a vibrating string, the wave equation is derived as:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} = c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial x^2}
$$

Where:
- $$ u(x,t) $$ is the displacement at position $$ x $$ and time $$ t $$.
- $$ c $$ is the wave speed, which depends on the tension and mass per unit length of the string.
- The term $$ \frac{\partial^2 u(x,t)}{\partial t^2} $$ represents the acceleration of the string.

---
### Example 3: **Laplace's Equation (Steady-State Heat Distribution)**

#### Physical Problem:
- We want to find the steady-state temperature distribution in a region where the heat conduction has reached equilibrium (i.e., no change in temperature over time).

#### Step 1: Identify the Variables
- **Dependent variable**: Temperature $$ u(x, y) $$ in the region.
- **Independent variables**: Spatial coordinates $$ x $$ and $$ y $$.

#### Step 2: Governing Law
- The governing law is **Fourier's Law** of heat conduction, but since the system is in steady-state, the time derivative is zero.

#### Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- The steady-state heat distribution is given by **Laplace's equation**:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial y^2} = 0
$$

Where:
- $$ u(x, y) $$ is the temperature at position $$ (x, y) $$.
- The terms $$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} $$ and $$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} $$ represent the spatial second derivatives of the temperature.

---
### Example 4: **Poisson's Equation (Electrostatics)**

#### Physical Problem:
- We want to find the electric potential $$ u(x, y) $$ in a region where there is a charge distribution.

#### Step 1: Identify the Variables
- **Dependent variable**: Electric potential $$ u(x, y) $$.
- **Independent variables**: Spatial coordinates $$ x $$ and $$ y $$.

#### Step 2: Governing Law
- The governing law is **Gauss's Law** in electrostatics, which relates the electric potential to the charge density.

#### Step 3: Mathematical Formulation
- The general form of Poisson's equation is:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u(x,y)}{\partial y^2} = f(x, y)
$$

Where:
- $$ u(x, y) $$ is the electric potential at position $$ (x, y) $$.
- $$ f(x, y) $$ represents the charge density at position $$ (x, y) $$.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- The **formulation** of PDEs typically begins with identifying the physical law governing the phenomenon, followed by translating that law into a mathematical expression using partial derivatives.
- **Boundary conditions** (e.g., temperature at the boundaries, displacement at the ends of the string) are crucial for solving PDEs.

## Solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)

There are several methods for solving **partial differential equations (PDEs)**. In this section, we'll discuss two important methods: **Direct Integration Method** and **Lagrange's Method**.

### 1. **Direct Integration Method**

The **Direct Integration Method** is used to solve PDEs that can be integrated directly without requiring complex transformations. This method is usually applicable to first-order linear and non-linear PDEs. It is based on the principle of finding the general solution to a PDE by integrating directly with respect to the dependent or independent variables.

#### Step-by-Step Process for Solving Using Direct Integration:

1. **Identify the PDE**: 
   Start by writing the PDE in a standard form.
   - Example of a first-order PDE:
     $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0 $$

2. **Separate Variables**: 
   Rearrange the PDE to separate the variables.
   - In the example above, we can write:
     $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} $$

3. **Integrate with Respect to One Variable**:
   Integrate the equation with respect to one of the variables, treating the other variable as a constant.
   - For the above equation:
     $$ u(x, y) = f(x - y) $$ 
     where $$ f $$ is an arbitrary function determined by boundary conditions or initial conditions.

4. **Apply Boundary or Initial Conditions**:
   Use any given boundary conditions or initial conditions to determine the form of the arbitrary function $$ f $$.

#### Example: Solving a First-Order PDE

Consider the first-order linear PDE:

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0 $$

**Step 1:** Separate the variables:

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = -\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} $$

**Step 2:** Integrate both sides:

- Integrating with respect to $$ x $$, we get:
  $$ u(x, y) = f(x - y) $$

**Step 3:** Apply any boundary or initial conditions (if provided) to determine the function $$ f $$.

For example, if the boundary condition is $$ u(0, y) = 0 $$, then $$ f(y) = 0 $$, leading to the solution:

$$ u(x, y) = 0 $$

---
### 2. **Lagrangeâ€™s Method**

**Lagrangeâ€™s Method** is a technique used for solving first-order linear partial differential equations. It is also known as the **Method of Characteristics**. This method is used to solve first-order PDEs by converting them into a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) along certain curves, known as **characteristics**, where the PDE becomes simpler.

#### Step-by-Step Process for Solving Using Lagrange's Method:

1. **Write the PDE in Standard Form**:  
   Start with the first-order PDE in the form:
   $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + a(x, y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = b(x, y) $$

2. **Determine the Characteristic Equations**:  
   The characteristic equations are derived from the original PDE and represent a system of ODEs that describe the trajectories (characteristics) along which the solution is constant.

   The characteristic equations are:
   $$ \frac{dx}{ds} = 1, \quad \frac{dy}{ds} = a(x, y), \quad \frac{du}{ds} = b(x, y) $$

   Where $$ s $$ is the parameter along the characteristics.

3. **Solve the Characteristic Equations**:  
   Solve the system of ODEs obtained from the characteristic equations.

4. **Find the General Solution**:  
   After solving for $$ x(s) $$, $$ y(s) $$, and $$ u(s) $$, you can express the solution $$ u(x, y) $$ in terms of these variables.

5. **Apply Boundary or Initial Conditions**:  
   Use boundary conditions or initial conditions to determine the constants of integration in the general solution.

#### Example: Solving a First-Order Linear PDE Using Lagrangeâ€™s Method

Consider the first-order linear PDE:

$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0 $$

**Step 1:** Write the PDE in standard form:
$$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + 1 \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 0 $$

Thus, $$ a(x, y) = 1 $$ and $$ b(x, y) = 0 $$.

**Step 2:** Determine the characteristic equations:
$$ \frac{dx}{ds} = 1, \quad \frac{dy}{ds} = 1, \quad \frac{du}{ds} = 0 $$

**Step 3:** Solve the system of equations:

- $$ \frac{dx}{ds} = 1 \Rightarrow x = s + C_1 $$
- $$ \frac{dy}{ds} = 1 \Rightarrow y = s + C_2 $$
- $$ \frac{du}{ds} = 0 \Rightarrow u = C_3 $$

From the equations $$ x = s + C_1 $$ and $$ y = s + C_2 $$, we can solve for $$ s $$:

- $$ s = x - C_1 $$
- Substituting this into the equation for $$ y $$, we get $$ y = x - C_1 + C_2 $$.

Thus, the general solution is:

$$ u(x, y) = f(y - x) $$

**Step 4:** Apply boundary or initial conditions to determine the function $$ f $$.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- **Direct Integration Method** works well for simple first-order PDEs where variables can be separated and integrated directly.
- **Lagrange's Method (Method of Characteristics)** is powerful for solving first-order PDEs where the characteristics provide a path along which the solution remains constant, simplifying the problem to solving ODEs along these curves.

## Non-Linear Partial Differential Equations of First Order

Non-linear first-order partial differential equations (PDEs) are equations in which the dependent variable and its derivatives appear in a non-linear manner. These equations are often more complex than linear PDEs and require specialized methods for solving. Non-linear first-order PDEs can often be written in **standard forms** that help in solving the equations using specific techniques.

### Standard Forms of Non-Linear First-Order PDEs

A general **non-linear first-order PDE** can be written in the form:

$$
F\left(x, y, u, p, q\right) = 0
$$

Where:
- $$ u = u(x, y) $$ is the unknown function.
- $$ p = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} $$ and $$ q = \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} $$ are the partial derivatives of $$ u $$ with respect to $$ x $$ and $$ y $$.
- $$ F $$ is a general function of the variables $$ x $$, $$ y $$, $$ u $$, $$ p $$, and $$ q $$.

There are **four standard forms** used to classify non-linear first-order PDEs. Each standard form represents a specific class of PDEs, and different methods are applied to solve them.

---
### 1. **Standard Form I (Quasi-Linear Equation)**

The **quasi-linear** form is one of the most common forms of first-order non-linear PDEs. In this form, the equation involves the first-order partial derivatives of $$ u $$, but is linear with respect to these derivatives.

The general form is:

$$
a(x, y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + b(x, y) \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = c(x, y, u)
$$

Where:
- $$ a(x, y) $$ and $$ b(x, y) $$ are known functions of $$ x $$ and $$ y $$.
- $$ c(x, y, u) $$ is a known function of $$ x $$, $$ y $$, and $$ u $$ (the unknown function).

#### Example of Standard Form I:

$$
x \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + y \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = u
$$

This is a **quasi-linear** PDE, and it can be solved using methods like **Charpit's method** or **method of characteristics**.

---
### 2. **Standard Form II (First-Order Non-Linear PDE)**

The general form for **non-linear first-order PDEs** can be expressed as:

$$
F\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}, u, x, y \right) = 0
$$

In this form, the PDE is non-linear in the derivatives of $$ u $$, and it is often not separable or directly integrable. This form requires advanced techniques such as **Charpitâ€™s method**, **Riemann's method**, or **Lagrange's method** to solve.

#### Example of Standard Form II:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 1
$$

This equation is non-linear due to the product of the partial derivatives $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} $$ and $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} $$.

---
### 3. **Standard Form III (Monge-AmpÃ¨re Equation)**

The **Monge-AmpÃ¨re equation** is a special form of non-linear PDEs of the second type. This type of PDE involves second-order derivatives but is often discussed as a non-linear first-order equation when considering its characteristic form.

The general form is:

$$
F\left( x, y, u, p, q, r \right) = 0
$$

Where $$ r $$ represents the second derivative $$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} $$, $$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} $$, or mixed derivatives.

#### Example of Standard Form III (Monge-AmpÃ¨re Equation):

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \right)^2
$$

This equation is highly non-linear and often requires **special methods** such as **method of characteristics** or **numerical methods** for solution.

---
### 4. **Standard Form IV (Fully Non-Linear Equation)**

The **fully non-linear** form of a first-order PDE is one where the unknown function and its derivatives appear in the equation in a highly non-linear manner. These equations are the most general and typically the most difficult to solve.

The general form is:

$$
F\left( x, y, u, p, q, \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) = 0
$$

Where the equation is highly non-linear with respect to the function and its derivatives.

#### Example of Standard Form IV:

$$
\left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right)^2 = u
$$

This equation involves **non-linear terms** and is not easily separable or solvable using simple methods. It often requires **numerical methods**, **Riemannâ€™s method**, or **Charpitâ€™s method**.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- Non-linear first-order PDEs can often be challenging to solve because they do not have the same straightforward methods as linear PDEs. Common methods used include **method of characteristics**, **Charpit's method**, and **Riemannâ€™s method**.
- The classification into **Standard Forms** helps identify the right method for solving the PDE. However, many non-linear PDEs may not have an explicit solution and may require numerical methods for approximation.

---
## Charpitâ€™s Method

**Charpitâ€™s method** is a technique used to solve first-order non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs). It is particularly effective for solving non-linear PDEs that are **quasi-linear** or in **standard form II** (non-linear first-order equations). The method involves transforming the PDE into a system of **ordinary differential equations (ODEs)** along **characteristics**. These characteristics are curves in the $$ x $$-$$ y $$ plane along which the solution is constant.

### General Form of First-Order Non-Linear PDE

A non-linear first-order PDE can typically be written in the following general form:

$$
F\left( x, y, u, p, q \right) = 0
$$

Where:
- $$ u = u(x, y) $$ is the unknown function.
- $$ p = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} $$, and $$ q = \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} $$.
- $$ F $$ is a function involving $$ x $$, $$ y $$, $$ u $$, $$ p $$, and $$ q $$.

### Charpitâ€™s Method: Step-by-Step Process

1. **Write the PDE in the standard form:**
   The PDE should be written as:
   $$ F(x, y, u, p, q) = 0 $$

2. **Set up the characteristic equations:**
   The key idea in Charpit's method is to convert the PDE into a system of **characteristic equations**. These equations describe curves in the $$ x $$-$$ y $$-plane along which the solution is constant.

   The characteristic equations are:
   $$
   \frac{dx}{ds} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial p}, \quad
   \frac{dy}{ds} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial q}, \quad
   \frac{du}{ds} = p \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} + q \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} - F
   $$

   Where:
   - $$ \frac{dx}{ds}, \frac{dy}{ds}, \frac{du}{ds} $$ are the derivatives of $$ x $$, $$ y $$, and $$ u $$ with respect to the parameter $$ s $$, which represents the characteristic curve.
   - $$ \frac{\partial F}{\partial p}, \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} $$ are the partial derivatives of $$ F $$ with respect to $$ p $$ and $$ q $$, respectively.

3. **Solve the system of characteristic equations:**
   By solving the characteristic equations, we can find the relationships between $$ x $$, $$ y $$, and $$ u $$. This is usually done by integrating these equations with respect to $$ s $$, and then solving for $$ u $$ in terms of $$ x $$ and $$ y $$.

4. **Apply initial or boundary conditions:**
   After solving the characteristic equations, apply the given initial or boundary conditions to determine the solution.

### Example 1: Charpitâ€™s Method for Solving a Non-Linear PDE

Consider the non-linear PDE:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = 1
$$

**Step 1:** Rewrite the equation in standard form:
$$
F\left( x, y, u, p, q \right) = p \cdot q - 1 = 0
$$

Where:
- $$ p = \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} $$
- $$ q = \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} $$

**Step 2:** Set up the characteristic equations:
The general characteristic equations are:
$$
\frac{dx}{ds} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} = q, \quad
\frac{dy}{ds} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} = p, \quad
\frac{du}{ds} = p \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial p} + q \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial q} - F = 0
$$

Since $$ F = p \cdot q - 1 $$, we have:
$$
\frac{dx}{ds} = q, \quad
\frac{dy}{ds} = p, \quad
\frac{du}{ds} = 0
$$

**Step 3:** Solve the system of equations:
We now solve the characteristic equations:
- $$ \frac{dx}{ds} = q $$ implies $$ x = qs + C_1 $$,
- $$ \frac{dy}{ds} = p $$ implies $$ y = ps + C_2 $$,
- $$ \frac{du}{ds} = 0 $$ implies $$ u = C_3 $$.

From $$ \frac{dx}{ds} = q $$ and $$ \frac{dy}{ds} = p $$, we can solve for $$ s $$ in terms of $$ x $$ and $$ y $$.

**Step 4:** Apply initial or boundary conditions:
After solving for the general solution, apply the boundary conditions (if provided) to find specific values for the constants $$ C_1 $$, $$ C_2 $$, and $$ C_3 $$.

---

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- Charpitâ€™s method is a powerful technique for solving **first-order non-linear PDEs** that can be expressed in the standard form. It works by converting the PDE into a set of **characteristic equations** that describe curves along which the solution remains constant.
- The solution obtained using Charpitâ€™s method often involves finding an implicit relationship between the variables $$ x $$, $$ y $$, and $$ u $$, which is then solved using the boundary or initial conditions.

## Partial Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients (Higher Orders Homogeneous)

In this section, we focus on solving **higher-order homogeneous partial differential equations (PDEs)** with **constant coefficients**. These are a class of linear PDEs where the unknown function depends on more than one variable and the coefficients of the derivatives are constants. Homogeneous equations mean that the equation is equal to zero, i.e., there are no external forcing terms.

### General Form of Higher-Order Homogeneous PDEs

A general **higher-order linear homogeneous PDE** with constant coefficients for an unknown function $$ u(x, y) $$ can be written as:

$$
A \frac{\partial^n u}{\partial x^n} + B \frac{\partial^m u}{\partial x^m} + C \frac{\partial^p u}{\partial y^p} + \cdots = 0
$$

Where:
- $$ A, B, C, \dots $$ are constant coefficients.
- $$ \frac{\partial^n u}{\partial x^n}, \frac{\partial^m u}{\partial x^m}, \dots $$ represent the various partial derivatives of the unknown function $$ u $$ with respect to $$ x $$ and $$ y $$, and the equation involves **higher derivatives**.
- The equation is **homogeneous** because it is equal to zero.

### Example of a Higher-Order Homogeneous PDE with Constant Coefficients

Consider a second-order homogeneous PDE with constant coefficients:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} - 2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0
$$

Here, the coefficients are constants (1 for the $$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} $$ term and -2 for the $$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} $$ term).

### Methods for Solving Higher-Order Homogeneous PDEs with Constant Coefficients

The solution method for such equations typically involves:
1. **Assuming a solution of the form**: $$ u(x, y) = e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} $$, where $$ \lambda_1 $$ and $$ \lambda_2 $$ are constants to be determined.
2. **Substituting the assumed solution into the equation**.
3. **Solving the characteristic equation** formed by substituting the assumed solution into the PDE.
4. **Using boundary or initial conditions** to find the constants and determine the solution.

Letâ€™s explore this approach step by step.

### Step 1: Assumption of the Solution Form

Assume the solution to the PDE is of the form:

$$
u(x, y) = e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y}
$$

Where $$ \lambda_1 $$ and $$ \lambda_2 $$ are constants that we need to determine. This is a common assumption when solving linear PDEs, as exponential functions tend to satisfy many types of linear equations.

---
### Step 2: Substitute the Assumed Solution into the PDE

Letâ€™s consider the following example:

$$
\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} - 2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0
$$

Substitute the assumed solution $$ u(x, y) = e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} $$ into the equation. First, we compute the partial derivatives:

- The first partial derivative with respect to $$ x $$ is:
  $$
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \lambda_1 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y}
  $$

- The second partial derivative with respect to $$ x $$ is:
  $$
  \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \lambda_1^2 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y}
  $$

- Similarly, the first and second partial derivatives with respect to $$ y $$ are:
  $$
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \lambda_2 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y}
  $$
  $$
  \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \lambda_2^2 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y}
  $$

Now, substitute these into the original PDE:

$$
\lambda_1^2 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} - 2 \lambda_2^2 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} = 0
$$

Factor out $$ e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} $$ (which is never zero):

$$
\lambda_1^2 - 2 \lambda_2^2 = 0
$$

---
### Step 3: Solve the Characteristic Equation

We now have the **characteristic equation**:

$$
\lambda_1^2 - 2 \lambda_2^2 = 0
$$

Solving for $$ \lambda_1 $$ and $$ \lambda_2 $$, we get:

$$
\lambda_1^2 = 2 \lambda_2^2
$$

Taking square roots:

$$
\lambda_1 = \pm \sqrt{2} \lambda_2
$$

Thus, we have two possible values for $$ \lambda_1 $$ and $$ \lambda_2 $$. This means that the general solution will involve **two independent solutions** corresponding to these values of $$ \lambda_1 $$ and $$ \lambda_2 $$.

---
### Step 4: General Solution

The general solution to the PDE is a linear combination of the two independent solutions. Therefore, the general solution to the PDE is:

$$
u(x, y) = A e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} + B e^{-\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y}
$$

Where $$ A $$ and $$ B $$ are constants to be determined from the **boundary conditions** or **initial conditions**.

### Example: Solving a Higher-Order Homogeneous PDE

Consider the third-order homogeneous PDE:

$$
\frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial x^3} + 2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = 0
$$

1. **Assume a solution** of the form $$ u(x, y) = e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} $$.
2. **Compute the partial derivatives**:
   - $$ \frac{\partial^3 u}{\partial x^3} = \lambda_1^3 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} $$
   - $$ \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \lambda_2^2 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} $$
3. **Substitute into the PDE**:
   $$
   \lambda_1^3 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} + 2 \lambda_2^2 e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} = 0
   $$

4. **Simplify** the equation:
   $$
   \lambda_1^3 + 2 \lambda_2^2 = 0
   $$

5. **Solve the characteristic equation**:
   $$ 
   \lambda_1^3 = -2 \lambda_2^2
   $$

   Solving this equation provides the possible values for $$ \lambda_1 $$ and $$ \lambda_2 $$, and the general solution can be written in terms of these solutions.

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- **Higher-order homogeneous PDEs** with constant coefficients can be solved by assuming solutions of the form $$ e^{\lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 y} $$, solving the characteristic equation, and using boundary conditions to find the constants of integration.
- The method of solving involves turning the PDE into an algebraic characteristic equation that can be solved for the constants involved in the solution.

## Method of Separation of Variables

The **method of separation of variables** is a widely used technique for solving linear partial differential equations (PDEs). This method works well when the PDE can be rewritten in such a way that the variables (typically $$ x $$, $$ y $$, etc.) can be separated into distinct functions of each variable. The main idea is to assume that the solution to the PDE can be expressed as a product of functions, each depending on only one of the independent variables.

### Step-by-Step Process

The method of separation of variables is often used for solving linear PDEs of the form:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \right)
$$

This is a second-order linear PDE, known as the **heat equation**. However, the method is also applicable to many other types of PDEs.

The general steps are:

### Step 1: Assume a Solution Form

Assume that the solution to the PDE can be written as a product of functions, each of which depends on a single variable. For example, if the PDE involves two variables $$ x $$ and $$ t $$, assume the solution takes the form:

$$
u(x, t) = X(x) T(t)
$$

Where:
- $$ X(x) $$ is a function of $$ x $$ alone,
- $$ T(t) $$ is a function of $$ t $$ alone.

### Step 2: Substitute into the PDE

Substitute the assumed solution $$ u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) $$ into the given PDE.

For example, consider the heat equation:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

Substitute $$ u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) $$ into this equation:

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \left( X(x) T(t) \right) = \alpha \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \left( X(x) T(t) \right)
$$

This gives:

$$
X(x) \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \alpha T(t) \frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2}
$$

### Step 3: Separate the Variables

The equation now involves terms that are functions of $$ x $$ on the left-hand side and terms that are functions of $$ t $$ on the right-hand side. To separate the variables, divide both sides by $$ X(x) T(t) $$:

$$
\frac{1}{\alpha T(t)} \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \frac{1}{X(x)} \frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2}
$$

Now, the left side depends only on $$ t $$, and the right side depends only on $$ x $$. Since the two sides are equal, each side must be equal to a constant, say $$ -\lambda $$. So, we get two separate ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

1. For the $$ t $$-dependent part:
   $$
   \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\lambda T(t)
   $$

2. For the $$ x $$-dependent part:
   $$
   \frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2} = -\lambda X(x)
   $$

### Step 4: Solve the ODEs

Now, we solve the two ordinary differential equations.

#### Solving for $$ T(t) $$:

The ODE for $$ T(t) $$ is:

$$
\frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\lambda T(t)
$$

This is a **first-order linear ODE**, and its solution is:

$$
T(t) = A e^{-\lambda t}
$$

Where $$ A $$ is a constant to be determined from the boundary conditions.

#### Solving for $$ X(x) $$:

The ODE for $$ X(x) $$ is:

$$
\frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2} = -\lambda X(x)
$$

This is a **second-order linear ODE**, and its solution depends on the sign of $$ \lambda $$:

1. **For $$ \lambda > 0 $$**, the solution is:

   $$
   X(x) = B \cos(\sqrt{\lambda} x) + C \sin(\sqrt{\lambda} x)
   $$

2. **For $$ \lambda = 0 $$**, the solution is:

   $$
   X(x) = Bx + C
   $$

3. **For $$ \lambda < 0 $$**, let $$ \mu = \sqrt{-\lambda} $$, and the solution becomes:

   $$
   X(x) = B e^{\mu x} + C e^{-\mu x}
   $$

Where $$ B $$ and $$ C $$ are constants to be determined from boundary conditions.

### Step 5: Combine the Solutions

The general solution to the PDE is the product of the solutions for $$ X(x) $$ and $$ T(t) $$:

$$
u(x, t) = \left( B \cos(\sqrt{\lambda} x) + C \sin(\sqrt{\lambda} x) \right) e^{-\lambda t}
$$

### Step 6: Apply Boundary and Initial Conditions

Use the given **boundary conditions** (for $$ x $$) and **initial conditions** (for $$ t $$) to determine the constants $$ B $$, $$ C $$, and $$ \lambda $$.

For example:
- Boundary conditions might specify $$ u(0, t) = 0 $$ and $$ u(L, t) = 0 $$ for a rod of length $$ L $$, which would help determine the allowed values of $$ \lambda $$ (such as integer multiples of $$ \pi $$).
- Initial conditions might specify the temperature distribution at $$ t = 0 $$, i.e., $$ u(x, 0) = f(x) $$.

### Example: Solving the Heat Equation Using Separation of Variables

Consider the heat equation on a rod of length $$ L $$, with boundary conditions $$ u(0, t) = u(L, t) = 0 $$, and initial condition $$ u(x, 0) = f(x) $$.

The PDE is:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
$$

Assume a solution of the form $$ u(x, t) = X(x) T(t) $$. Substituting into the heat equation gives:

$$
X(x) \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \alpha T(t) \frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2}
$$

Separate the variables:

$$
\frac{1}{\alpha T(t)} \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = \frac{1}{X(x)} \frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2}
$$

Both sides are equal to a constant $$ -\lambda $$, which gives the two ODEs:

1. $$ \frac{dT(t)}{dt} = -\lambda T(t) $$
2. $$ \frac{d^2 X(x)}{dx^2} = -\lambda X(x) $$

The solution for $$ T(t) $$ is:

$$
T(t) = A e^{-\lambda t}
$$

The solution for $$ X(x) $$ with boundary conditions $$ X(0) = X(L) = 0 $$ is:

$$
X(x) = B \sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right)
$$

Where $$ \lambda = \left( \frac{n\pi}{L} \right)^2 $$, with $$ n = 1, 2, 3, \dots $$.

Thus, the general solution is:

$$
u(x, t) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} B_n \sin\left( \frac{n\pi x}{L} \right) e^{-\left( \frac{n\pi}{L} \right)^2 \alpha t}
$$

To determine $$ B_n $$, we use the initial condition $$ u(x, 0) = f(x) $$, and expand $$ f(x) $$ in a Fourier sine series.

### ðŸ’¡ **TIP:**
- The **separation of variables** method works best for linear PDEs where the equation can be split into independent ODEs. It's commonly used for heat, wave, and Laplace equations.
- When applying boundary and initial conditions, often the solution will involve an infinite series, which can be truncated or approximated for practical solutions.
