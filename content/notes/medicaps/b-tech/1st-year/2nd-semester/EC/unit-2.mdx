## Polymer Introduction

### **Definition of Polymer**
A **polymer** is a large macromolecule composed of repeating structural units called **monomers** linked together by covalent bonds. The word **polymer** is derived from the Greek words *"poly"* meaning **many** and *"meros"* meaning **parts**.

**Example:** Polyethylene is a polymer formed from repeated units of **ethylene** (`CH₂=CH₂`).

---

### **Monomers and Polymers Relationship**
- **Monomer:** A small, simple molecule capable of bonding with similar molecules.  
  **Example:** Ethylene, Styrene, Vinyl chloride.  
- **Polymer:** A large complex structure formed by the repetition of monomers.  
  **Example:** Polyethylene (from ethylene monomers).

💡 **TIP:** Polymers can consist of thousands to millions of monomers, creating high molecular weight compounds.

## Preparation of Polymers

Polymers are prepared through a process called **polymerization**, where small molecules called **monomers** chemically bond to form long-chain macromolecules. The preparation methods vary depending on the type of monomer and polymer desired. 

### **Types of Polymerization Methods**
Polymers are generally prepared using two primary polymerization techniques:

---

### **1. Addition Polymerization (Chain-Growth Polymerization)**
- **Definition:** Monomers with double or triple bonds react to form a polymer without any by-product formation.  
- **Mechanism:** Involves breaking of the double bond in the monomer and linking monomers together through **free radical** or **ionic mechanisms**.  
- **Monomer Requirement:** Unsaturated compounds like **ethylene** and **styrene**.  

### **Steps Involved:**
#### **a. Initiation:**
- The reaction starts when a free radical initiator (like benzoyl peroxide) breaks the double bond of the monomer.  

**Example:**
$$
\text{C}_2\text{H}_4 \xrightarrow{Initiator} \cdot CH_2-CH_2
$$

---

#### **b. Propagation:**
- The reactive site propagates as more monomers add to the chain.  

**Example:**
$$
\cdot CH_2-CH_2 + CH_2=CH_2 \rightarrow \cdot CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2
$$

---

#### **c. Termination:**
- The chain stops growing when two radicals combine or when a termination agent deactivates the reaction.  

**Example:**
$$
\cdot CH_2-CH_2-CH_2-CH_2 \rightarrow \text{Polyethylene (PE)}
$$

---

### **Examples of Addition Polymers:**
- **Polyethylene (PE):** Used in plastic bags and bottles.  
- **Polystyrene (PS):** Used in packaging materials.  
- **Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC):** Used in pipes and insulation.  

---

### **2. Condensation Polymerization (Step-Growth Polymerization)**
- **Definition:** Monomers react with the elimination of small molecules like water, HCl, or ammonia.  
- **Monomer Requirement:** Bifunctional or polyfunctional monomers (with functional groups like –COOH, –OH, –NH₂).  

---

### **Steps Involved:**
#### **a. Reaction of Functional Groups:**
- Monomers react at their functional groups, forming a bond and releasing a small molecule.  

**Example (Nylon-6,6 formation):**
$$
\text{Hexamethylenediamine (H}_2N-(CH_2)_6-NH_2\text{)} + \text{Adipic Acid (COOH-(CH_2)_4-COOH)}
$$

#### **b. Polymer Chain Formation:**
- Repeated condensation reactions continue, forming a polymer chain.  

**Example:**
$$
\text{(NH-(CH_2)_6-NH-CO-(CH_2)_4-CO)}_n + nH_2O
$$

---

### **Examples of Condensation Polymers:**
- **Nylon-6,6:** Used in textiles and ropes.  
- **Polyester (Terylene):** Used in fabrics and bottles.  
- **Bakelite:** Used in electrical switches and kitchenware.  

---

### **3. Copolymerization**
- **Definition:** Two different monomers polymerize together to form a copolymer.  
- **Types of Copolymers:**
  - **Random Copolymer:** Monomers randomly arranged (e.g., Styrene-Butadiene Rubber).  
  - **Block Copolymer:** Monomers grouped in blocks (e.g., Styrene-Butadiene Block Copolymer).  
  - **Alternating Copolymer:** Monomers alternate in the chain (e.g., Nylon 6,6).  

---

### **4. Ring-Opening Polymerization**
- **Definition:** A cyclic compound opens up and polymerizes into a linear polymer.  
- **Example:** Polycaprolactone, used in biodegradable plastics.  

---

### **5. Emulsion Polymerization**
- **Definition:** Polymerization occurs in an aqueous medium where monomers are emulsified using surfactants.  
- **Example:** **Synthetic Rubber (SBR)** and **PVC.**
