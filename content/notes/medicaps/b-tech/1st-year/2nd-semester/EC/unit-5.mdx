## Concept of Enthalpy

### Definition of Enthalpy
**Enthalpy ($$H$$)** is a thermodynamic property that represents the total heat content of a system. It is defined as:

$$
H = U + PV
$$

where:  
- $$H$$ = Enthalpy (Joules)  
- $$U$$ = Internal Energy of the system (J)  
- $$P$$ = Pressure (Pa)  
- $$V$$ = Volume (m³)

Enthalpy is a **state function**, meaning it depends only on the current state of the system, not the path taken to reach that state.

---

### Understanding Enthalpy Change ($$ \Delta H $$)

The **change in enthalpy** ($$ \Delta H $$) represents the heat absorbed or released during a chemical reaction at constant pressure:

$$
\Delta H = H_{\text{final}} - H_{\text{initial}}
$$

or  

$$
\Delta H = \Delta U + P\Delta V
$$

where:  
- $$\Delta U$$ = Change in internal energy  
- $$P\Delta V$$ = Work done due to expansion or compression  

---

### Types of Enthalpy Changes

#### **1. Standard Enthalpy of Formation ($$ \Delta H_f^\circ $$):**
- The enthalpy change when **1 mole** of a compound is formed from its elements under standard conditions.  
- Example:  

   $$ \text{C(graphite)} + O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) \quad \Delta H_f^\circ = -393.5 \, \text{kJ/mol} $$

---

#### **2. Enthalpy of Combustion ($$ \Delta H_c $$):**
- The heat released when **1 mole** of a substance completely combusts in oxygen.  
- Example:  

   $$ CH_4(g) + 2O_2(g) \rightarrow CO_2(g) + 2H_2O(l) \quad \Delta H_c = -890 \, \text{kJ/mol} $$

---

#### **3. Enthalpy of Neutralization:**
- The heat change when **1 mole** of water is formed from the neutralization of an acid and a base.  
- Example:  

   $$ HCl(aq) + NaOH(aq) \rightarrow NaCl(aq) + H_2O(l) $$

---

#### **4. Enthalpy of Fusion ($$ \Delta H_f $$):**
- The heat required to convert **1 mole** of a solid into a liquid without temperature change.

---

#### **5. Enthalpy of Vaporization ($$ \Delta H_v $$):**
- The heat required to convert **1 mole** of a liquid into a gas without temperature change.

---

### Enthalpy and Heat Transfer

- At **constant pressure**, the heat exchanged in a process equals the enthalpy change:  

  $$ q_p = \Delta H $$  

- At **constant volume**, the heat exchanged relates to the internal energy change:  

  $$ q_v = \Delta U $$  

---

### Applications of Enthalpy

- **Chemical Reactions:** Predicting exothermic and endothermic reactions.  
- **Industrial Processes:** Calculations for heat management in chemical plants.  
- **Thermodynamics:** Essential in phase changes and heat engines.  

---

### Exothermic vs. Endothermic Reactions

- **Exothermic Reactions:** Release heat, $$\Delta H < 0$$.  
- **Endothermic Reactions:** Absorb heat, $$\Delta H > 0$$.  

---

### Limitations of Enthalpy

- Enthalpy does not indicate the **rate** of a reaction.  
- Cannot determine the **spontaneity** of a reaction alone (requires Gibbs free energy).  

---

### Summary
**Enthalpy ($$H$$)** is a fundamental concept in thermodynamics representing heat content. It plays a crucial role in understanding heat flow during physical and chemical processes. The enthalpy change $$ \Delta H $$ helps classify reactions as **exothermic** or **endothermic**, aiding in various scientific and industrial applications.

## Entropy and Free Energy

### Entropy ($$S$$)

### **Definition:**
**Entropy ($$S$$)** is a measure of the disorder or randomness in a system. It describes the distribution of energy among particles in a thermodynamic system.

- **Higher Entropy:** Greater disorder and energy dispersion.  
- **Lower Entropy:** More ordered and less energy dispersion.  

### **Mathematical Expression:**
The change in entropy is defined as:

$$
\Delta S = \frac{q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
$$

where:  
- $$\Delta S$$ = Change in entropy (J/mol·K)  
- $$q_{\text{rev}}$$ = Heat absorbed in a reversible process (J)  
- $$T$$ = Temperature in Kelvin (K)  

---

### **Key Concepts of Entropy:**
- **State Function:** Depends only on the state of the system, not the path taken.  
- **Extensive Property:** Depends on the amount of substance.  
- **Units:** Joules per mole per Kelvin (J/mol·K).  

---

### **Entropy Change in Physical Processes:**
- **Solid → Liquid → Gas:** Entropy increases.  
- **Gas Compression:** Entropy decreases.  
- **Dissolution of Salt:** Entropy increases due to increased ion dispersion.

---

### **Second Law of Thermodynamics:**
**"The total entropy of an isolated system always increases over time."**

Mathematically:

$$
\Delta S_{\text{universe}} = \Delta S_{\text{system}} + \Delta S_{\text{surroundings}} \geq 0
$$

---

### **Entropy of the Universe:**
- **Spontaneous Process:** $$ \Delta S_{\text{universe}} > 0 $$.  
- **Equilibrium:** $$ \Delta S_{\text{universe}} = 0 $$.  

---

## Free Energy (Gibbs Free Energy)

### **Definition:**
**Gibbs Free Energy ($$G$$)** is the maximum amount of work a system can perform at constant temperature and pressure. It helps determine the spontaneity of a chemical reaction.

### **Mathematical Expression:**
The Gibbs free energy change is defined as:

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S
$$

where:  
- $$\Delta G$$ = Change in Gibbs Free Energy (J)  
- $$\Delta H$$ = Change in Enthalpy (J)  
- $$T$$ = Temperature (K)  
- $$\Delta S$$ = Change in Entropy (J/K)  

---

|------------------------------------|----------------|
| $$ \Delta G < 0 $$                | **Spontaneous** |
| $$ \Delta G > 0 $$                | **Non-Spontaneous** |
| $$ \Delta G = 0 $$                | **Equilibrium** |

---

### **Standard Gibbs Free Energy Change ($$ \Delta G^\circ $$):**
The standard Gibbs free energy change can be calculated using standard enthalpy and entropy values:

$$
\Delta G^\circ = \sum \Delta G^\circ_{\text{products}} - \sum \Delta G^\circ_{\text{reactants}}
$$

---

### **Relation Between $$ \Delta G $$ and Equilibrium Constant (K):**

The relationship between Gibbs free energy and the equilibrium constant $$K$$ is:

$$
\Delta G^\circ = -RT \ln K
$$

where:  
- $$R$$ = Universal gas constant ($$8.314 \, \text{J/mol·K}$$)  
- $$T$$ = Temperature (K)  
- $$K$$ = Equilibrium constant  

---

### **Key Differences Between Entropy and Free Energy:**

|------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Definition**               | Disorder in a system       | Energy available to do work |
| **Unit**                    | J/mol·K                    | J/mol                       |
| **Spontaneity Indicator?**   | No, requires total entropy | Yes, if $$\Delta G < 0$$     |
| **Mathematical Expression**  | $$ \Delta S = \frac{q}{T} $$ | $$ \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S $$ |

---

### **Summary:**
- **Entropy ($$S$$)** measures disorder and energy dispersion.  
- **Gibbs Free Energy ($$G$$)** predicts reaction spontaneity.  
- **$$\Delta G < 0$$** → Spontaneous process.  
- **$$\Delta G > 0$$** → Non-spontaneous process.

## EMF (Electromotive Force)

### **Definition:**
**Electromotive Force (EMF)** is the maximum potential difference between two electrodes of an electrochemical cell when no current flows. It drives the flow of electrons in a circuit and is often denoted by $$ \mathcal{E} $$.

- **Unit:** Volts (V)  
- **Symbol:** $$ \mathcal{E} $$  
- **Type:** Scalar Quantity  

---

### **Explanation:**
- EMF is not a force but rather the energy supplied per unit charge by a power source.  
- It originates from chemical reactions in electrochemical cells or the movement of charges due to magnetic fields.  

---

### **Mathematical Expression:**
EMF can be mathematically defined as:

$$
\mathcal{E} = \frac{W}{Q}
$$

where:  
- $$ \mathcal{E} $$ = Electromotive Force (V)  
- $$W$$ = Work done in moving charge (Joules)  
- $$Q$$ = Charge moved (Coulombs)  

---

### **Measurement of EMF:**
- EMF is measured using a **voltmeter** connected across the terminals of a battery in an open circuit (no current flow).  
- EMF can also be determined using a **potentiometer**, which avoids current flow and ensures accurate measurement.

---

### **Factors Affecting EMF:**
- **Nature of Electrodes:** Different metals generate different EMFs due to their electrode potentials.  
- **Electrolyte Concentration:** Varies with ion concentration.

$$

- **Anode (Oxidation):** Zn → Zn²⁺ + 2e⁻  
- **Cathode (Reduction):** Cu²⁺ + 2e⁻ → Cu  

**Overall Cell Reaction:**

$$
Zn(s) + Cu^{2+}(aq) \rightarrow Zn^{2+}(aq) + Cu(s)
$$

---

### **Calculating EMF of a Cell:**
The EMF of a galvanic cell can be calculated using the standard reduction potentials ($$E^\circ$$):

$$
\mathcal{E}_{\text{cell}} = E^\circ_{\text{cathode}} - E^\circ_{\text{anode}}
$$

where:  
- $$E^\circ_{\text{cathode}}$$ = Standard reduction potential of cathode  
- $$E^\circ_{\text{anode}}$$ = Standard reduction potential of anode  

**Example:**  
- $$E^\circ_{\text{Cu}} = +0.34 \, V$$  
- $$E^\circ_{\text{Zn}} = -0.76 \, V$$  

$$
\mathcal{E}_{\text{cell}} = (+0.34) - (-0.76) = +1.10 \, V
$$

---

### **Nernst Equation (Non-Standard Conditions):**
The **Nernst Equation** calculates EMF under non-standard conditions:

$$
\mathcal{E}_{\text{cell}} = \mathcal{E}^\circ_{\text{cell}} - \frac{RT}{nF} \ln Q
$$

where:

## Corrosion: Definition, Types, Causes, and Protection from Corrosion

### **Definition of Corrosion**
**Corrosion** is the gradual destruction or deterioration of metals and alloys due to their reaction with environmental factors such as moisture, oxygen, and chemicals.

It results in the conversion of metals into their **oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, or carbonates**, leading to material weakening and structural failure.

**Example:**  
- Rusting of iron:  
   $$ 4Fe + 3O_2 + 6H_2O \rightarrow 4Fe(OH)_3 $$
   (Iron hydroxide further dehydrates to form **Fe₂O₃·xH₂O**, commonly known as rust.)

- **Example:** Rusting of iron exposed to moist air.  

---

### **2. Galvanic Corrosion:**
- Occurs when two dissimilar metals are in contact in the presence of an electrolyte.  
- The more reactive metal (anode) corrodes faster, while the less reactive metal (cathode) is protected.  
- **Example:** Zinc corroding when in contact with copper in seawater.  

---

### **3. Pitting Corrosion:**
- Localized corrosion forming small pits or holes on the metal surface.  
- Often occurs due to **chloride ions** attacking the protective oxide layer.
