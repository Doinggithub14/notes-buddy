Where:  
- $$H$$ = Height of the chimney (m)  
- $$d$$ = Draught head required (Pa)  
- $$\rho_a$$ = Density of atmospheric air (kg/m³)  
- $$\rho_g$$ = Density of flue gases (kg/m³)  

---

### **Draught Head (d):**
The draught head is calculated based on the pressure difference required to maintain the flow of air and removal of flue gases.  

$$
d = H \times (\rho_a - \rho_g)
$$

---

### **Calculation Steps:**
1. **Determine Required Draught Head (d):**  
   - Based on the boiler design and combustion requirements.  
2. **Calculate Densities:**  
   - **Atmospheric Air Density ($$\rho_a$$)**: Approx. 1.293 kg/m³ at standard temperature.  
   - **Flue Gas Density ($$\rho_g$$)**: Calculated using the specific temperature and gas composition.  
3. **Apply the Formula:**  
   - Plug the values into the formula to determine the chimney height.

---

### **Example Calculation:**

**Problem:**  
Calculate the required height of a chimney for a boiler where:  
- Required draught head = 20 Pa  
- Density of atmospheric air ($$\rho_a$$) = 1.293 kg/m³  
- Density of flue gases ($$\rho_g$$) = 1.2 kg/m³  

**Solution:**  
$$
H = \frac{d}{(\rho_a - \rho_g)}
$$

$$
H = \frac{20}{(1.293 - 1.2)}
$$

$$
H = \frac{20}{0.093} \approx 215.05 \, m
$$

**Answer:** The required chimney height is approximately **215 meters**.

### **Factors Affecting Chimney Height:**
- **Fuel Type:** Fuels with higher sulfur content require taller chimneys to disperse pollutants.  
- **Efficiency of Draught:** Higher draught requires taller chimneys.  
- **Temperature of Flue Gases:** Hotter gases rise faster, affecting chimney height.  
- **Local Environmental Regulations:** Height limits for emission control.

### **Applications:**
- Power plants.  
- Industrial boilers.  
- Incinerators.  
- Large-scale heating plants.

## Boiler Efficiency and Numerical

### **Boiler Efficiency**
### **Definition:**
Boiler efficiency is the ratio of useful heat energy absorbed by the steam to the heat energy supplied by the fuel. It indicates how effectively the boiler converts fuel energy into steam energy.

### **Mathematical Formula:**
$$
\eta = \frac{\text{Heat Output (Useful Heat)}}{\text{Heat Input (Fuel Energy)}} \times 100
$$

### **Heat Output:**
The heat absorbed by the steam is calculated using the formula:

$$
\text{Heat Output} = m_s \times (h - h_f)
$$

Where:  
- $$m_s$$ = Mass of steam produced (kg/hr)  
- $$h$$ = Enthalpy of steam (kJ/kg)  
- $$h_f$$ = Enthalpy of feedwater (kJ/kg)  

### **Heat Input:**
The heat supplied by the fuel is calculated using:

$$
\text{Heat Input} = m_f \times C_v
$$

Where:  
- $$m_f$$ = Mass of fuel burnt (kg/hr)  
- $$C_v$$ = Calorific value of fuel (kJ/kg)  

---

### **Methods to Determine Boiler Efficiency:**

### **1. Direct Method:**
- Simple and straightforward.  
- Compares heat output with heat input.  
- Formula:  
  $$
  \eta = \frac{m_s \times (h - h_f)}{m_f \times C_v} \times 100
  $$

### **2. Indirect Method (Heat Loss Method):**
- Identifies individual heat losses to calculate efficiency.  
- Formula:  
  $$
  \eta = 100 - (L_1 + L_2 + L_3 + \ldots)
  $$
  Where:  
  - $$L_1$$ = Dry flue gas heat loss  
  - $$L_2$$ = Loss due to incomplete combustion  
  - $$L_3$$ = Radiation loss

### **Numerical Problem 1:**
**Problem:**  
A boiler produces **5000 kg/hr** of steam at **10 bar** with an enthalpy of **2776 kJ/kg**. Feedwater enters the boiler at **60°C** with an enthalpy of **251.1 kJ/kg**. The fuel consumption rate is **600 kg/hr**, and the calorific value of the fuel is **42000 kJ/kg**. Calculate the boiler efficiency using the **direct method**.

**Solution:**

- $$m_s = 5000 \ \text{kg/hr}$$  
- $$h = 2776 \ \text{kJ/kg}$$  
- $$h_f = 251.1 \ \text{kJ/kg}$$  
- $$m_f = 600 \ \text{kg/hr}$$  
- $$C_v = 42000 \ \text{kJ/kg}$$  

**Heat Output:**
$$
\text{Heat Output} = 5000 \times (2776 - 251.1)  
= 5000 \times 2524.9 = 12624500 \ \text{kJ/hr}
$$

**Heat Input:**
$$
\text{Heat Input} = 600 \times 42000 = 25200000 \ \text{kJ/hr}
$$

**Efficiency:**
$$
\eta = \frac{12624500}{25200000} \times 100 = 50.1\%
$$

**Answer:** The boiler efficiency is **50.1%**.

### **Numerical Problem 2:**
**Problem:**  
A boiler burns **500 kg/hr** of coal with a calorific value of **28000 kJ/kg**. The heat losses are as follows:  
- Dry flue gas loss: **8%**  
- Loss due to unburnt fuel: **3%**  
- Radiation loss: **2%**  

Calculate the boiler efficiency using the **indirect method**.

**Solution:**

Total heat losses:  
$$L_1 + L_2 + L_3 = 8 + 3 + 2 = 13\%$$

Efficiency:  
$$
\eta = 100 - 13 = 87\%
$$

**Answer:** The boiler efficiency is **87%**.

---

### **Factors Affecting Boiler Efficiency:**
### **1. Fuel Quality:**
- Higher calorific value improves efficiency.  

### **2. Air Supply:**
- Excess air leads to heat loss, while insufficient air leads to incomplete combustion.  

### **3. Heat Losses:**
- Flue gas losses, radiation, and incomplete combustion reduce efficiency.  

### **4. Insulation:**
- Proper insulation minimizes heat loss.  

---

### **Methods to Improve Boiler Efficiency:**
### **1. Using Economizers:**
- Preheats the feedwater using exhaust gases.  

### **2. Air Preheaters:**
- Preheats the air before entering the combustion chamber.  

### **3. Blowdown Control:**
- Regular blowdown prevents scaling and deposits.  

### **4. Proper Fuel Selection:**
- Using fuels with higher calorific value.
