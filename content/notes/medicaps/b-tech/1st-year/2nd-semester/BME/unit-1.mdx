## Composition of Cast Iron and Carbon Steels and Their Applications

### Cast Iron: Composition and Applications

**Cast iron** is an alloy of iron, carbon, and silicon with a carbon content typically ranging between **2% to 4%**. The high carbon content makes it more brittle than steel but excellent for certain structural applications due to its hardness and wear resistance.

## Hooke's Law and Modulus of Elasticity

### Hooke's Law

**Hooke's Law** describes the relationship between the force applied to a material and the deformation it experiences within the elastic limit. It states:

> **The strain in a material is directly proportional to the applied stress within the elastic limit.**

### **Mathematical Expression:**
$$
\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon
$$

Where:  
- $$ \sigma $$ = Stress (Pa or N/m²)  
- $$ E $$ = Modulus of Elasticity (Pa or N/m²)  
- $$ \epsilon $$ = Strain (dimensionless)  

### **Stress and Strain Definitions:**
- **Stress ($$ \sigma $$)**: The internal force per unit area within a material.  
   $$
   \sigma = \frac{F}{A}
   $$
   Where:  
   - $$ F $$ = Applied force (N)  
   - $$ A $$ = Cross-sectional area (m²)  

- **Strain ($$ \epsilon $$)**: The relative deformation experienced by the material.  
   $$
   \epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L}
   $$
   Where:  
   - $$ \Delta L $$ = Change in length (m)  
   - $$ L $$ = Original length (m)  

---

### **Elastic Limit and Proportional Limit:**
- **Elastic Limit:** The maximum stress that a material can withstand without permanent deformation.  
- **Proportional Limit:** The point up to which Hooke's law is valid, stress is proportional to strain.

---

### **Graphical Representation of Hooke's Law:**
**Stress-Strain Curve:**
- **Linear Region:** Stress is proportional to strain (Hooke's law holds).  
- **Elastic Limit:** The point where permanent deformation begins.  
- **Plastic Region:** Beyond the elastic limit, permanent deformation occurs.  
- **Fracture Point:** The material breaks under stress.

---

### **Modulus of Elasticity (Young's Modulus)**

The **Modulus of Elasticity (E)**, also called **Young's Modulus**, is a measure of a material's stiffness or rigidity. It quantifies how much a material will deform under stress before permanent deformation occurs.

### **Formula:**
$$
E = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon}
$$

- **High $$E$$** → Stiff material (e.g., Steel)  
- **Low $$E$$** → Flexible material (e.g., Rubber)

---

### **Units of Modulus of Elasticity:**
- SI Unit: **Pascals (Pa)** or $$N/m²$$  
- Often expressed in **GPa (Giga Pascals)** for engineering materials.

---

### **Typical Values of Young's Modulus:**
- **Steel:** 200 GPa  
- **Aluminium:** 70 GPa  
- **Rubber:** 0.01 GPa  
- **Concrete:** 30 GPa

|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Definition**              | Force per unit area         | Deformation per unit length    |
| **Formula**                 | $$ \sigma = \frac{F}{A} $$ | $$ \epsilon = \frac{\Delta L}{L} $$ |
| **Units**                   | Pascal (Pa)                | Dimensionless                  |
| **Physical Meaning**        | Internal resistance to force| Degree of deformation          |

### **Applications of Hooke's Law and Modulus of Elasticity:**
- **Structural Design:** Used for calculating stress limits in bridges and buildings.  
- **Material Selection:** Helps engineers choose materials based on their stiffness.
