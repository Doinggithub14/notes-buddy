## Four-Stroke Petrol Engine

### **Definition:**
A **four-stroke petrol engine** is an internal combustion engine (ICE) that operates on four distinct strokes (intake, compression, power, and exhaust) to complete one power cycle. It uses petrol (gasoline) as fuel and operates on the **Otto cycle**, converting chemical energy into mechanical work.

---

### **Main Components:**
- **Cylinder:** Houses the piston and fuel-air mixture.  
- **Piston:** Reciprocates inside the cylinder to perform work.  
- **Crankshaft:** Converts reciprocating motion into rotary motion.  
- **Connecting Rod:** Links the piston to the crankshaft.  
- **Spark Plug:** Ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture.  
- **Valves:** Control the entry of the air-fuel mixture and the exit of exhaust gases.  
   - **Inlet Valve:** Allows fuel-air mixture to enter the cylinder.  
   - **Exhaust Valve:** Allows burned gases to exit the cylinder.  

---

### **Working Principle:**
The four-stroke petrol engine works on the principle of the **Otto Cycle** involving four strokes of the piston in one complete cycle of the engine.

---

### **1. Intake (Suction) Stroke:**
- **Objective:** Draw air-fuel mixture into the cylinder.  
- **Valve Action:** Inlet valve opens, exhaust valve closes.  
- **Piston Movement:** Moves from **Top Dead Centre (TDC)** to **Bottom Dead Centre (BDC)**.  
- **Process:**  
   - The downward movement of the piston creates a vacuum.  
   - Air-fuel mixture enters the cylinder.  

---

### **2. Compression Stroke:**
- **Objective:** Compress the air-fuel mixture for efficient combustion.  
- **Valve Action:** Both valves remain closed.  
- **Piston Movement:** Moves from **BDC** to **TDC**.  
- **Process:**  
   - The piston moves upward, compressing the air-fuel mixture.  
   - The compression increases the pressure and temperature of the mixture.  

---

### **3. Power (Combustion) Stroke:**
- **Objective:** Convert chemical energy into mechanical work.  
- **Valve Action:** Both valves remain closed.  
- **Piston Movement:** Moves from **TDC** to **BDC**.  
- **Process:**  
   - The spark plug generates a spark, igniting the compressed fuel-air mixture.  
   - The combustion generates high-pressure gases, forcing the piston downward.  
   - This stroke performs useful work on the crankshaft.  

---

### **4. Exhaust Stroke:**
- **Objective:** Expel exhaust gases from the cylinder.  
- **Valve Action:** Exhaust valve opens, inlet valve closed.  
- **Piston Movement:** Moves from **BDC** to **TDC**.  
- **Process:**  
   - The piston moves upward, pushing the burned gases out through the exhaust valve.  
   - The cycle repeats with the next intake stroke.  

---

### **Working Cycle Summary:**
- **1st Stroke:** **Intake** – Air-fuel mixture enters.  
- **2nd Stroke:** **Compression** – Mixture compressed.  
- **3rd Stroke:** **Power** – Combustion generates work.  
- **4th Stroke:** **Exhaust** – Burned gases expelled.

- Cars and motorcycles.  
- Lawn mowers.  
- Generators.  
- Small aircraft engines.

## Two-Stroke Petrol Engine

### **Definition:**
A **two-stroke petrol engine** is an internal combustion engine that completes a power cycle in just **two strokes** of the piston (one revolution of the crankshaft). It is simpler and more compact compared to a four-stroke engine and commonly used in small vehicles and tools.

---

### **Main Components:**
- **Cylinder:** Houses the piston and combustion process.  
- **Piston:** Reciprocates inside the cylinder to perform work.  
- **Crankshaft:** Converts reciprocating motion into rotary motion.  
- **Connecting Rod:** Links the piston to the crankshaft.  
- **Spark Plug:** Ignites the fuel-air mixture.  
- **Inlet and Exhaust Ports:** Openings for air-fuel intake and exhaust gas release.  
- **Transfer Port:** Transfers the air-fuel mixture from the crankcase to the cylinder.  

---

### **Working Principle:**
A **two-stroke petrol engine** completes the thermodynamic cycle with two strokes of the piston — one downward and one upward. The engine relies on **port timing** instead of separate valves for intake and exhaust.

---

### **1. Upward Stroke (Compression + Intake):**
- **Objective:** Compress the fuel-air mixture while drawing a fresh charge into the crankcase.  
- **Piston Movement:** Moves from **Bottom Dead Centre (BDC)** to **Top Dead Centre (TDC)**.  
- **Process:**  
   - The piston moves upward, compressing the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber.  
   - The upward motion creates a vacuum in the crankcase, drawing a fresh air-fuel mixture through the inlet port.  
   - The **spark plug** ignites the compressed mixture near the end of the stroke.  

---

### **2. Downward Stroke (Power + Exhaust):**
- **Objective:** Perform work and expel exhaust gases.  
- **Piston Movement:** Moves from **TDC** to **BDC**.  
- **Process:**  
   - The ignited fuel-air mixture expands rapidly, pushing the piston downward.  
   - As the piston moves down, the **exhaust port** opens, allowing burned gases to escape.  
   - Simultaneously, the **transfer port** opens, and a fresh charge of fuel-air mixture enters the cylinder from the crankcase, completing the cycle.  

---

### **Key Features of a Two-Stroke Petrol Engine:**
- **Simpler Design:** Fewer components compared to a four-stroke engine.  
- **No Separate Valves:** Uses ports for gas exchange.  
- **Every Revolution Produces Power:** One power stroke per crankshaft revolution.  
- **Mixing of Oil and Fuel:** Lubrication occurs by mixing oil directly with fuel.  

---

### **Advantages:**
- **Higher Power Output:** Every revolution of the crankshaft generates power.  
- **Lightweight and Compact:** Fewer components make it smaller and lighter.  
- **Simple Construction:** Easier to maintain and manufacture.  

---

### **Disadvantages:**
- **Lower Efficiency:** Partial mixing of fresh charge and exhaust gases.  
- **Higher Fuel Consumption:** Less complete combustion.  
- **More Emissions:** Due to incomplete fuel burning and oil mixing with fuel.  

---

### **Applications of Two-Stroke Petrol Engines:**
- Motorcycles and scooters.  
- Chainsaws and lawnmowers.  
- Marine outboard motors.  
- Portable generators.
