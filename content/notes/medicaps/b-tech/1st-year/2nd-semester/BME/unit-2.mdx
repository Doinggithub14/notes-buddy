## Thermodynamic Properties and Systems

### **Thermodynamic Properties**

**Thermodynamic properties** are measurable characteristics of a system that describe its physical state. These properties help define the condition of a system and determine how energy transfer occurs within it.

### **Types of Thermodynamic Properties:**

### 1. **Intensive Properties:**
   - Independent of the amount of substance in the system.  
   - **Examples:** Temperature, Pressure, Density, Specific Volume.  

### 2. **Extensive Properties:**

   - **Unit:** Pascal (Pa), N/m².  
   - **Formula:**  
     $$
     P = \frac{F}{A}

## First Law of Thermodynamics

### **Definition:**
The **First Law of Thermodynamics** is a fundamental principle of energy conservation. It states:

> **Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed from one form to another.**

In thermodynamic terms, the total energy of an isolated system remains constant.

---

### **Mathematical Expression:**
The first law for a closed system can be expressed as:

$$
\Delta U = Q - W
$$

Where:  
- $$ \Delta U $$ = Change in internal energy (J)  
- $$ Q $$ = Heat added to the system (J)  
- $$ W $$ = Work done by the system (J)  

---

### **Explanation of Terms:**
1. **Internal Energy (U):**
   - The total microscopic energy of a system due to molecular motion and interactions.  
   - **Increases** when heat is added or work is done on the system.  

2. **Heat (Q):**
   - Energy transfer due to a temperature difference.  
   - Positive when heat **enters** the system.  

3. **Work (W):**
   - Energy transfer due to force applied over a distance.  
   - Positive when work is **done by** the system on the surroundings.  

---

### **Forms of the First Law for Different Processes:**

#### **1. Isothermal Process (Constant Temperature):**
   - $$ \Delta U = 0 $$ since temperature is constant.  
   - Work done by the system = Heat supplied.  
   $$
   Q = W
   $$

#### **2. Adiabatic Process (No Heat Transfer):**
   - $$ Q = 0 $$.  
   - Work done results in a change in internal energy.  
   $$
   \Delta U = -W
   $$

#### **3. Isobaric Process (Constant Pressure):**
   - Work is done as volume changes at constant pressure.  
   - $$ Q \neq W $$ due to heat and work exchange.  
   $$
   Q = \Delta U + P \Delta V
   $$

#### **4. Isochoric Process (Constant Volume):**
   - $$ W = 0 $$ as volume remains constant.  
   - Heat added only increases internal energy.  
   $$
   Q = \Delta U
   $$

---

### **Energy Flow Diagram:**
- **Positive Work:** Work done **by** the system on the surroundings.  
- **Negative Work:** Work done **on** the system by the surroundings.  

---

### **Applications of the First Law of Thermodynamics:**

#### **1. Heat Engines:**
   - Converts heat energy into work.  
   - Follows the principle of energy conservation.  

#### **2. Refrigerators and Heat Pumps:**
   - Work is done on the system to transfer heat from a colder body to a hotter body.  

#### **3. Internal Combustion Engines:**
   - Chemical energy of fuel is converted into mechanical work.  

#### **4. Boilers and Turbines:**
   - Heat energy is converted into steam to perform mechanical work.  

---

### **Limitations of the First Law of Thermodynamics:**
- It explains **energy conservation** but not the **direction** of heat flow.  
- Cannot explain the concept of **entropy** or irreversibility.  

---

## Thermal Processes at Constant Pressure (Isobaric Process)

### **Definition:**
An **isobaric process** is a thermodynamic process in which the **pressure remains constant** throughout the process, while heat and work transfer occur, leading to changes in volume and temperature.

---

### **Key Characteristics of an Isobaric Process:**
- **Constant Pressure:** $$ P = \text{constant} $$.  
- **Heat Transfer Occurs:** Heat energy can enter or leave the system.  
- **Work Done:** Work is performed due to the change in volume.  
- **Change in Internal Energy:** Internal energy changes due to temperature change.  

---

### **Mathematical Representation:**
The **First Law of Thermodynamics** applies to an isobaric process:

$$
Q = \Delta U + W
$$

Where:  
- $$ Q $$ = Heat added to the system.  
- $$ \Delta U $$ = Change in internal energy.  
- $$ W $$ = Work done by the system.  

### **Work Done in an Isobaric Process:**
Since pressure is constant, the work done by the gas can be calculated using:

$$
W = P \Delta V
$$

Where:  
- $$P$$ = Pressure (constant)  
- $$\Delta V$$ = Change in volume  

---

### **Heat Transfer (Q):**
The heat added during an isobaric process can be calculated using the formula:

$$
Q = m C_p \Delta T
$$

Where:  
- $$m$$ = Mass of the substance  
- $$C_p$$ = Specific heat capacity at constant pressure  
- $$\Delta T$$ = Change in temperature  

---

### **Graphical Representation (P-V Diagram):**
- The graph for an **isobaric process** on a **Pressure-Volume (P-V)** diagram is a **horizontal line** since pressure remains constant while volume changes.

---

### **Examples of Isobaric Processes:**
- **Boiling Water:** The pressure remains constant while heat is added, causing phase change.  
- **Heating Air in a Piston Cylinder:** When the piston moves to adjust volume while pressure stays constant.  
- **Atmospheric Heating:** Air expanding in the atmosphere during heating.  

---

### **Applications of Isobaric Processes:**
- **Steam Power Plants:** Expansion of steam in turbines.  
- **Refrigeration Cycles:** Constant pressure heat absorption.  
- **Chemical Reactions in Open Vessels:** Reactions occurring under atmospheric pressure.  

---

### **Key Equations Summary:**
- **Work Done:** $$ W = P \Delta V $$  
- **Heat Transfer:** $$ Q = m C_p \Delta T $$  
- **First Law:** $$ Q = \Delta U + P\Delta V $$  

---

## Second Law of Thermodynamics

### **Definition of the Second Law of Thermodynamics**
The **Second Law of Thermodynamics** states that:

> **Heat energy cannot spontaneously flow from a colder body to a hotter body without external work being done.**

It introduces the concept of entropy and the natural direction of energy transfer, emphasizing that processes occur in a particular direction in nature and not in reverse spontaneously.

---

### **Key Concepts of the Second Law**

### **1. Entropy (S):**
Entropy is a measure of disorder or randomness in a system. It quantifies the degree of energy dispersion during a thermodynamic process.

- **Increase in Entropy:** Systems tend toward higher disorder.  
- **Entropy Change Formula:**  
   $$
   \Delta S = \frac{Q_{\text{rev}}}{T}
   $$  
   Where:  
   - $$Q_{\text{rev}}$$ = Reversible heat transfer  
   - $$T$$ = Absolute temperature in Kelvin  

---

### **2. Direction of Heat Flow:**
- Heat naturally flows from a **hotter** body to a **colder** body.  
- The reverse process (cold to hot) requires external energy (like in refrigerators).  

---

### **3. Irreversibility:**
The Second Law implies that natural processes are **irreversible** due to entropy increase.  
- **Example:** Ice melting into water, heat transfer from hot coffee to the surrounding air.

---

### **Mathematical Formulation:**

#### **For a Reversible Cycle:**
$$
\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T} = 0
$$

#### **For an Irreversible Cycle:**
$$
\oint \frac{\delta Q}{T} < 0
$$

- $$m$$ = Mass (kg)  

---

### **Entropy Change for Different Processes:**

\Delta S = \frac{Q}{T}
$$

#### **4. Adiabatic Process:**
$$
\Delta S = 0 \quad (\text{for a reversible adiabatic process})
$$

---

## Heat Engine and Heat Pump

---

### **Heat Engine**

---

### **Efficiency of a Heat Engine:**
The efficiency ($$ \eta $$) of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of useful work output to heat input.

$$
\eta = \frac{W}{Q_H}
$$

Since $$W = Q_H - Q_C$$:

$$
\eta = \frac{Q_H - Q_C}{Q_H}
$$

or,

$$
\eta = 1 - \frac{Q_C}{Q_H}
$$

Where:  
- $$ \eta $$ = Efficiency  
- $$ Q_H $$ = Heat absorbed from the source  
- $$ Q_C $$ = Heat rejected to the sink  
- $$ W $$ = Work output  

---

### **Carnot Heat Engine (Ideal Efficiency):**

3. **Condensation:** The high-pressure gas releases heat to the high-temperature region.  
4. **Expansion:** The refrigerant expands and cools, returning to the evaporator.  

---

### **Coefficient of Performance (COP):**
The **efficiency** of a heat pump is measured by the **Coefficient of Performance (COP)**, which is the ratio of heat delivered to the work input.

$$
COP = \frac{Q_H}{W}
$$

Since $$W = Q_H - Q_C$$:

$$
COP = \frac{Q_H}{Q_H - Q_C}
$$

Where:  
- $$COP$$ = Coefficient of Performance

## Refrigerator and Their Numerical

---

### **Definition of a Refrigerator:**
A **refrigerator** is a heat transfer device designed to remove heat from a low-temperature space and reject it to a high-temperature space using external work. It operates on the principle of the **Reverse Carnot Cycle** and requires mechanical energy input.

---

### **Working Principle:**
A refrigerator transfers heat from a cooler region (inside the fridge) to a warmer region (outside) by doing work on the refrigerant.

---

### **Components of a Refrigerator:**
1. **Evaporator:** Absorbs heat from the refrigerated space.  
2. **Compressor:** Compresses the refrigerant gas, increasing pressure and temperature.  
3. **Condenser:** Releases heat to the surroundings.  
4. **Expansion Valve:** Expands the refrigerant, reducing pressure and temperature before entering the evaporator.  

---

### **Working Cycle:**
1. **Evaporation:** The refrigerant absorbs heat from the inside of the refrigerator, turning into a low-pressure gas.  
2. **Compression:** The refrigerant is compressed, increasing its temperature and pressure.  
3. **Condensation:** Heat is released to the surroundings as the refrigerant condenses back to liquid.  
4. **Expansion:** The refrigerant expands and cools further, preparing for the next cycle.

---

### **Coefficient of Performance (COP) for a Refrigerator:**
The **Coefficient of Performance (COP)** measures the efficiency of a refrigerator. It is the ratio of the heat extracted from the cold space to the work input.

$$
COP = \frac{Q_C}{W}
$$

Since $$W = Q_H - Q_C$$:

$$
COP = \frac{Q_C}{Q_H - Q_C}
$$

Where:  
- $$COP$$ = Coefficient of Performance  
- $$Q_C$$ = Heat extracted from the cold space (J)  
- $$Q_H$$ = Heat rejected to the surroundings (J)  
- $$W$$ = Work input (J)  

---

### **Numerical Example 1:**
**Problem:**  
A refrigerator extracts $$200 \, \text{J}$$ of heat from the cold space and rejects $$300 \, \text{J}$$ of heat to the surroundings. Calculate the work done and the COP of the refrigerator.

**Solution:**
- $$Q_C = 200 \, \text{J}$$  
- $$Q_H = 300 \, \text{J}$$  

**Work Done:**
$$
W = Q_H - Q_C = 300 - 200 = 100 \, \text{J}
$$

**COP:**
$$
COP = \frac{Q_C}{W} = \frac{200}{100} = 2
$$

**Answer:**  
- Work done = $$100 \, \text{J}$$  
- COP = 2  

---

### **Numerical Example 2:**
**Problem:**  
A refrigerator operates with a COP of 4. If the work input is $$150 \, \text{J}$$, calculate the heat removed from the cold space and the heat rejected to the surroundings.

**Solution:**
- $$COP = 4$$  
- $$W = 150 \, \text{J}$$  

**Heat Removed ($$Q_C$$):**
$$
Q_C = COP \times W = 4 \times 150 = 600 \, \text{J}
$$

**Heat Rejected ($$Q_H$$):**
$$
Q_H = W + Q_C = 150 + 600 = 750 \, \text{J}
$$

**Answer:**  
- Heat removed from cold space = $$600 \, \text{J}$$

### **Numerical Example 3:**
**Problem:**  
A refrigerator working between $$4^\circ C$$ (cold space) and $$35^\circ C$$ (hot space) operates on a Carnot cycle. Calculate the maximum possible COP.

**Solution:**  
Convert temperatures to Kelvin:  
- $$T_C = 4^\circ C + 273 = 277 \, \text{K}$$  
- $$T_H = 35^\circ C + 273 = 308 \, \text{K}$$

**Carnot COP Formula:**
$$
COP = \frac{T_C}{T_H - T_C}
$$

$$
COP = \frac{277}{308 - 277} = \frac{277}{31} \approx 8.94
$$

**Answer:**  
- Maximum possible COP = 8.94
