## Algorithms  

### 1. **Definition of an Algorithm**  
An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or a finite sequence of well-defined instructions to solve a specific problem. It takes input, processes it, and produces an output.

### 2. **Key Characteristics of an Algorithm**  
- **Finiteness**: An algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.  
- **Definiteness**: Each step of the algorithm must be clear and unambiguous.  
- **Input**: An algorithm should accept zero or more inputs.  
- **Output**: An algorithm must produce at least one output.  
- **Effectiveness**: All operations in the algorithm must be basic enough to be executed with a finite amount of effort.  

### 3. **Importance of Algorithms**  
Algorithms play a crucial role in computer science for:  
- Solving computational problems efficiently.  
- Optimising resource utilisation.  
- Building scalable systems and software.  

### 4. **Steps to Design an Algorithm**  
- **Understand the Problem**: Define the problem and identify its constraints.  
- **Plan the Solution**: Break the problem into smaller sub-problems and identify a logical flow of steps.  
- **Write the Algorithm**: Represent the solution as a sequence of steps in pseudo-code or flowcharts.  
- **Validate the Algorithm**: Test the algorithm with different inputs to ensure correctness.  

### 5. **Algorithm Analysis**  
Algorithms are analysed based on:  
- **Time Complexity**: The amount of time an algorithm takes to complete.  
- **Space Complexity**: The amount of memory space an algorithm requires.  

üí° **TIP**: Always aim for an algorithm with lower time and space complexity to optimise performance.

### 6. **Types of Algorithms**  
- **Brute Force**: Tries all possible solutions to find the correct one.  
- **Divide and Conquer**: Breaks the problem into smaller sub-problems, solves them, and combines the results.  
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solves problems by breaking them into overlapping sub-problems and storing their results to avoid re-computation.  
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Makes locally optimal choices at each step to find a global solution.  
- **Backtracking**: Explores possible solutions by building incrementally and backtracking as soon as a solution is not feasible.  
## Analysis of Algorithms  

### 1. **Definition**  
The analysis of algorithms is the process of determining the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time and space usage. It helps compare different algorithms to identify the most optimal solution for a given problem.  

---

### 2. **Why Analyse Algorithms?**  
- To measure performance across various input sizes.  
- To choose the best algorithm for a specific application.  
- To optimise resource usage (time and memory).  

---

### 3. **Types of Analysis**  
- **Worst-case Analysis**: Determines the maximum time or space an algorithm takes for any input size.  
- **Best-case Analysis**: Evaluates the minimum time or space an algorithm requires for favourable inputs.  
- **Average-case Analysis**: Computes the expected time or space required for random inputs.  

---

### 4. **Metrics for Algorithm Analysis**  
#### (a) **Time Complexity**  
- **Definition**: The time taken by an algorithm to complete as a function of input size $$n$$.

#### (b) **Space Complexity**  
- **Definition**: The amount of memory required by an algorithm as a function of input size $$n$$.  
- Includes both fixed and variable memory allocations.  

üí° **TIP**: Focus on algorithms with both low time and space complexities for practical applications.

---

### 5. **Big-O Notation**  
- **Definition**: Represents the upper bound of an algorithm‚Äôs runtime, indicating its worst-case performance.  
- Common complexities:  
  - $$O(1)$$: Constant time.  
  - $$O(\log n)$$: Logarithmic time.  
  - $$O(n)$$: Linear time.  
  - $$O(n^2)$$: Quadratic time.  

---

### 6. **Trade-offs in Algorithm Design**  
- **Time vs. Space**: Faster algorithms may require more memory, while space-efficient algorithms may be slower.  
- **Simplicity vs. Efficiency**: Simple algorithms may be easier to implement but might not perform optimally for large input sizes.  

---

### 7. **Steps in Algorithm Analysis**  
1. Identify the input size $$n$$.  
2. Count the basic operations performed as a function of $$n$$.  
3. Express the operation count using mathematical notations.  
4. Simplify the expression to determine the time and space complexity.  

üìù **NOTE**: Algorithm analysis is crucial for building scalable and efficient systems.  

## Performance Issues: Time and Space Complexity  

### 1. **Overview**  
Performance issues in algorithms primarily focus on two key factors:  
- **Time Complexity**: The time required by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size.  
- **Space Complexity**: The amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution.

Efficient algorithms optimise both time and space to ensure optimal performance, especially for large input sizes.

---

### 2. **Time Complexity**  
- **Definition**: Measures the number of basic operations executed by an algorithm as a function of the input size ($$n$$).  
- **Factors Affecting Time Complexity**:  
  - Size and nature of the input.  
  - Type of operations performed.  
  - Control structures (loops, recursion).  

#### (a) **Asymptotic Notations**:  
Used to express the growth rate of time complexity:  
- $$O(n)$$ (Big-O): Worst-case performance.  
- $$\Omega(n)$$ (Omega): Best-case performance.  
- $$\Theta(n)$$ (Theta): Average-case performance.

#### (b) **Common Time Complexities**:  
- **Constant Time** ($$O(1)$$): Independent of input size.  
- **Linear Time** ($$O(n)$$): Increases proportionally with input size.  
- **Quadratic Time** ($$O(n^2)$$): Performance degrades rapidly as input size increases.  
- **Logarithmic Time** ($$O(\log n)$$): Efficient for large inputs.  

---

### 3. **Space Complexity**  
- **Definition**: Quantifies the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of the input size ($$n$$).  
- **Components of Space Complexity**:  
  - **Fixed Part**: Memory required for constants, program code, and variables.  
  - **Variable Part**: Memory required during execution (e.g., recursion stack, temporary variables).

---

### 4. **Trade-offs Between Time and Space Complexity**  
- Faster algorithms often use more memory (e.g., precomputing results).  
- Space-efficient algorithms may take longer to execute.  

üìù **NOTE**: The choice of algorithm depends on the application's requirements, available hardware, and acceptable trade-offs.

---

### 5. **Strategies to Address Performance Issues**  
1. **Optimise Loops**: Reduce unnecessary iterations and nested loops.  
2. **Minimise Recursion**: Replace recursion with iterative solutions where possible to save stack memory.  
3. **Use Efficient Data Structures**: Choose data structures that minimise time and space (e.g., hash tables, binary search trees).  
4. **Precomputations**: Use techniques like memoisation and caching to save computation time.  

üí° **TIP**: Balance time and space efficiency to meet real-world application constraints.

## Asymptotic Notations  

### 1. **Definition**  
Asymptotic notations describe the growth rate of an algorithm's time or space complexity as the input size ($$n$$) approaches infinity. These notations provide a mathematical way to evaluate and compare the efficiency of algorithms.  

---

### 2. **Purpose**  
- To analyse algorithm performance independently of hardware and implementation details.  
- To focus on the dominant term in a complexity expression, ignoring constants and lower-order terms.  

---

### 3. **Types of Asymptotic Notations**  

#### (a) **Big-O Notation ($$O$$)**  
- **Definition**: Represents the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate, focusing on the worst-case performance.  
- **Interpretation**: An algorithm is $$O(f(n))$$ if it does not take more than $$c \cdot f(n)$$ time for sufficiently large $$n$$.  
- **Usage**: Ensures an algorithm performs within a specified time limit.  

---

#### (b) **Omega Notation ($$\Omega$$)**  
- **Definition**: Represents the lower bound of an algorithm's growth rate, focusing on the best-case performance.  
- **Interpretation**: An algorithm is $$\Omega(f(n))$$ if it takes at least $$c \cdot f(n)$$ time for sufficiently large $$n$$.  
- **Usage**: Guarantees a minimum performance level.  

---

#### (c) **Theta Notation ($$\Theta$$)**  
- **Definition**: Represents both the upper and lower bounds of an algorithm's growth rate, focusing on the average-case performance.  
- **Interpretation**: An algorithm is $$\Theta(f(n))$$ if its time complexity is bounded both above and below by $$c_1 \cdot f(n)$$ and $$c_2 \cdot f(n)$$.  
- **Usage**: Provides the most precise growth rate of an algorithm.  

---

### 4. **Significance of Asymptotic Notations**  
- Helps compare algorithms regardless of implementation specifics.  
- Simplifies complexity analysis by ignoring less significant terms and constants.  
- Assists in understanding scalability and performance trends for large input sizes.  

üí° **TIP**: Use Big-O for worst-case analysis, Omega for best-case guarantees, and Theta for overall performance.  

---

### 5. **Comparison of Asymptotic Notations**  

| Notation      | Description            | Focus      | Example Usage       |  
|---------------|------------------------|------------|---------------------|  
| Big-O ($$O$$) | Upper bound (worst case) | Efficiency | $$O(n^2)$$          |

| Theta ($$\Theta$$) | Tight bound (average case) | Precision  | $$\Theta(n \log n)$$|  

## Mathematical Preliminaries: Functions & Their Growth Rates  

### 1. **Overview**  
Functions and their growth rates are fundamental to analysing algorithm performance. They help determine how an algorithm's resource usage (time or space) scales with input size.  

---

### 2. **Functions**  
- A **function** $$ f(n) $$ maps input size $$ n $$ to the amount of time or space an algorithm consumes.  
- Common types of functions used in algorithm analysis include:  
  - **Constant Function**: $$ f(n) = c $$  
  - **Linear Function**: $$ f(n) = n $$  
  - **Quadratic Function**: $$ f(n) = n^2 $$  
  - **Logarithmic Function**: $$ f(n) = \log n $$  
  - **Exponential Function**: $$ f(n) = 2^n $$  

---

### 3. **Growth Rates**  
Growth rates describe how a function increases as the input size $$ n $$ becomes large. They help in predicting the scalability and efficiency of algorithms.  

#### (a) **Dominance of Growth Rates**  
The growth rates of functions can be ranked as follows (from slowest to fastest):  
1. $$ O(1) $$: Constant  
2. $$ O(\log n) $$: Logarithmic  
3. $$ O(n) $$: Linear  
4. $$ O(n \log n) $$: Log-linear  
5. $$ O(n^2) $$: Quadratic  
6. $$ O(2^n) $$: Exponential  

#### (b) **Implication**  
- Algorithms with slower growth rates are more efficient for large inputs.  
- For example, $$ O(\log n) $$ grows much slower than $$ O(n^2) $$, making logarithmic algorithms more scalable.

---

### 4. **Types of Growth Functions**  

| **Function Type** | **Expression**       | **Growth Description**                       |  
|--------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| Constant           | $$ c $$             | Remains the same regardless of input size.  |  
| Linear             | $$ n $$             | Grows proportionally with input size.       |  
| Quadratic          | $$ n^2 $$           | Grows rapidly with the square of input size.|  
| Logarithmic        | $$ \log n $$        | Grows slowly as input size increases.       |  
| Exponential        | $$ 2^n $$           | Grows extremely fast; impractical for large inputs. |  

---

### 5. **Why Growth Rates Matter**  
- Growth rates help identify bottlenecks in algorithm performance.  
- They are essential for choosing the right algorithm for specific applications.  
- Focus on algorithms with optimal growth rates to handle large data sets efficiently.  

üìù **NOTE**: Always prioritise algorithms with the lowest growth rates whenever possible.  

## Recurrence Relations  

### 1. **Definition**  
A recurrence relation expresses the running time of an algorithm as a function of its input size and the running time of smaller inputs. It is commonly used in analysing recursive algorithms.  

---

### 2. **General Form**  
A recurrence relation is typically written as:  
$$
T(n) = g(n) + h(n) \cdot T(f(n))
$$  
Where:  
- $$ T(n) $$: Time complexity for input size $$ n $$.  
- $$ g(n) $$: Additional work done outside recursive calls (e.g., splitting, merging).  
- $$ h(n) $$: Number of recursive calls.  
- $$ f(n) $$: Size of the input in recursive calls.  

---

### 3. **Examples of Recurrence Relations**  

#### (a) **Linear Recurrence**  
$$
T(n) = T(n-1) + c
$$  
- Represents algorithms with one recursive call that reduces the problem size by 1.  

#### (b) **Divide-and-Conquer Recurrence**  
$$
T(n) = a \cdot T\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + g(n)
$$  
- Common in divide-and-conquer algorithms like merge sort.  

---

### 4. **Solving Recurrence Relations**  

#### (a) **Substitution Method**  
- Guess the solution and prove it by mathematical induction.  

#### (b) **Recursion Tree Method**  
- Visualise the recurrence as a tree and calculate the work done at each level.  

#### (c) **Master Theorem**  
Used to solve divide-and-conquer recurrences of the form:  
$$
T(n) = a \cdot T\left(\frac{n}{b}\right) + g(n)
$$  
Where:  
- $$ a $$: Number of subproblems.  
- $$ b $$: Factor by which the problem size is divided.  
- $$ g(n) $$: Cost of dividing and merging.  

The solution depends on the comparison of $$ g(n) $$ with $$ n^{\log_b a} $$:  
1. If $$ g(n) = O(n^{\log_b a - \epsilon}) $$, $$ T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a}) $$.  
2. If $$ g(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a}) $$, $$ T(n) = \Theta(n^{\log_b a} \log n) $$.  
3. If $$ g(n) = \Omega(n^{\log_b a + \epsilon}) $$, $$ T(n) = \Theta(g(n)) $$.

üìù **NOTE**: Choose the method based on the type and complexity of the recurrence relation.  

## Elementary Sorting Techniques and Its Analysis: Selection Sort  

### 1. **Introduction**  
Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.

---

### 2. **Working of Selection Sort**  
- Divide the array into two parts:  
  1. Sorted portion (initially empty).  
  2. Unsorted portion (initially the entire array).  
- Repeat the following steps until the unsorted portion becomes empty:  
  1. Find the minimum (or maximum) element in the unsorted portion.  
  2. Swap it with the first element of the unsorted portion.  
  3. Move the boundary of the sorted portion by one element.  

---

### 3. **Algorithm**  
1. For $$ i = 0 $$ to $$ n-1 $$:  
   - Find the index of the minimum element in the unsorted portion (from $$ i $$ to $$ n-1 $$).  
   - Swap the minimum element with the element at index $$ i $$.  

---

- **Best Case**: $$ O(n^2) $$  
- **Average Case**: $$ O(n^2) $$  
- **Worst Case**: $$ O(n^2) $$  
  - In all cases, the algorithm makes $$ n(n-1)/2 $$ comparisons, regardless of the initial order.  

#### (b) **Space Complexity**  
- **Auxiliary Space**: $$ O(1) $$  
  - Selection Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm.  

#### (c) **Stability**  
- **Stability**: Not stable  
  - The relative order of equal elements may not be preserved because of swapping.  

#### (d) **Adaptability**  
- Selection Sort is not adaptive, as it performs the same number of comparisons regardless of the input order.  

---

### 5. **Advantages**  
- Simple and easy to understand.  
- Does not require additional memory beyond the input array.  
- Performs well on small datasets.  

---

### 6. **Disadvantages**  
- Inefficient on large datasets due to $$ O(n^2) $$ time complexity.  
- Not suitable for datasets where stability is critical.  

---

üìù **NOTE**: Selection Sort is primarily used for educational purposes and is rarely used in practical applications due to its inefficiency on large datasets.  

## Bubble Sort

### 1. **Introduction**
Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until no swaps are required, indicating that the list is sorted.

---

### 2. **Working of Bubble Sort**
- Compare each pair of adjacent elements in the list.
- If the elements are in the wrong order, swap them.
- After each pass through the list, the largest unsorted element is "bubbled" to its correct position.
- Repeat the process for all elements until no more swaps are needed.

---

### 3. **Algorithm**
1. For $$ i = 0 $$ to $$ n-1 $$:  
   - For $$ j = 0 $$ to $$ n-i-2 $$:  
     - If the element at index $$ j $$ is greater than the element at index $$ j+1 $$, swap them.  
   - After the $$ i $$-th iteration, the largest element is placed at the correct position.

---

### 4. **Analysis of Bubble Sort**

#### (a) **Time Complexity**
- **Best Case**: $$ O(n) $$  
  - Occurs when the array is already sorted. Only one pass is needed to check that no swaps are required.
- **Average Case**: $$ O(n^2) $$  
  - Occurs for randomly ordered elements, where each element may require comparisons with every other element.
- **Worst Case**: $$ O(n^2) $$  
  - Occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order, and each element needs to be compared and swapped multiple times.

#### (b) **Space Complexity**
- **Auxiliary Space**: $$ O(1) $$  
  - Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm.

#### (c) **Stability**
- **Stability**: Stable  
  - Bubble Sort is stable as equal elements retain their relative order.

#### (d) **Adaptability**
- Bubble Sort is adaptive in the sense that it may take fewer passes if the array is nearly sorted.

---

### 5. **Advantages**
- Simple and easy to implement.
- Works well for small datasets or nearly sorted data.
- Stable sorting algorithm.

---

### 6. **Disadvantages**
- Inefficient on large datasets due to $$ O(n^2) $$ time complexity.
- Not suitable for practical use on large or unordered datasets due to its poor time efficiency.

---

üìù **NOTE**: While Bubble Sort is easy to understand and implement, it is rarely used in practical applications due to its inefficiency, especially for large datasets.

## Insertion Sort

### 1. **Introduction**
Insertion Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It builds the final sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly picking the next element and inserting it into its correct position among the previously sorted elements.

---

### 2. **Working of Insertion Sort**
- Begin with the second element, as the first element is already considered sorted.
- Compare the current element with the elements in the sorted portion of the array.
- Shift the larger elements one position to the right to make space for the current element.
- Insert the current element into its correct position.
- Repeat this process until the entire array is sorted.

---

### 3. **Algorithm**
1. For $$ i = 1 $$ to $$ n-1 $$:
   - Set the current element as `key` (i.e., element at index $$ i $$).
   - Compare `key` with the elements before it and shift elements greater than `key` one position to the right.
   - Insert `key` in the correct position.

---

### 4. **Analysis of Insertion Sort**

#### (a) **Time Complexity**
- **Best Case**: $$ O(n) $$  
  - Occurs when the array is already sorted, as each element is inserted without shifting any elements.
- **Average Case**: $$ O(n^2) $$  
  - Occurs when the array is in random order and requires comparisons and shifting for each element.
- **Worst Case**: $$ O(n^2) $$  
  - Occurs when the array is sorted in reverse order and requires maximum shifting and comparisons.

#### (b) **Space Complexity**
- **Auxiliary Space**: $$ O(1) $$  
  - Insertion Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm.

#### (c) **Stability**
- **Stability**: Stable  
  - Insertion Sort is stable as equal elements retain their relative order.

#### (d) **Adaptability**
- Insertion Sort is adaptive, meaning it performs better on nearly sorted data, with fewer shifts and comparisons.

---

### 5. **Advantages**
- Simple to implement and easy to understand.
- Performs well on small datasets or nearly sorted data.
- Stable sorting algorithm.
- In-place sorting, requiring only a small constant amount of additional memory.

---

### 6. **Disadvantages**
- Inefficient for large datasets due to $$ O(n^2) $$ time complexity.
- Performs poorly when the array is unsorted or very large.

---

üìù **NOTE**: Insertion Sort is often used for small datasets or when the data is nearly sorted. It is also a good choice for sorting linked lists.
