4. **Deliver as Fast as Possible**:
   - By delivering small, incremental updates frequently, Lean focuses on delivering value to customers as quickly as possible. This ensures that teams can gather feedback early, make improvements, and avoid building unnecessary features.

5. **Empower the Team**:
   - Lean encourages self-organizing teams that are empowered to make decisions at the local level. This decentralization ensures that teams can react quickly to changes and make decisions that are in the best interest of the project.

6. **Build Integrity In**:
   - Lean emphasizes the importance of building quality into the development process rather than relying on later testing or inspection. By addressing quality issues early, teams can avoid costly defects and rework down the line.

7. **See the Whole**:
   - Lean advocates for viewing the development process holistically, ensuring that all parts of the system are working efficiently together. It discourages optimizing individual components at the expense of the overall system, which could lead to inefficiencies.

---

### Lean Practices in Agile

1. **Value Stream Mapping**:
   - This practice involves visualizing the entire process from idea to delivery to identify areas of waste and inefficiency. By mapping the flow of work, teams can pinpoint bottlenecks and streamline their processes to increase value delivery.

2. **Kaizen (Continuous Improvement)**:
   - Lean promotes a culture of continuous improvement through Kaizen, where teams regularly reflect on their processes, identify areas for improvement, and make incremental changes. This is often done through regular retrospectives or feedback loops.

3. **Kanban**:
   - While Kanban is often associated with Agile, it is also a core part of Lean practices. The Kanban system helps visualize the flow of work, limit work in progress (WIP), and ensure that teams are not overloaded with tasks, reducing the potential for waste.

4. **Pull Systems**:
   - Lean uses a pull system where work is only started when there is a clear demand for it, instead of pushing work onto the team. This ensures that resources are used efficiently and that tasks are completed in response to real needs.

5. **Just-in-Time Production**:
   - Just-in-time production ensures that features or tasks are worked on only when they are needed, preventing the waste associated with overproduction or unnecessary work. This approach aligns with Agile's focus on delivering features incrementally based on priority.

---
