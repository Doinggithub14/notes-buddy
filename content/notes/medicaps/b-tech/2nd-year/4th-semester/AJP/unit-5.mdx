## Data Access Operations with JDBC Template and Spring

### Introduction to JDBC Template
- **JDBC Template** is a part of the Spring Framework that simplifies database interaction.
- It provides a high-level API to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on databases.
- The **JDBC Template** removes the need for manually managing connections, handling exceptions, and other boilerplate code related to database operations.

ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** JDBC Template handles all the low-level details of database communication, allowing you to focus on writing business logic.

### Setting Up JDBC Template in Spring
1. **Add Dependencies:**
   - Ensure you have the necessary dependencies in your `pom.xml` file for Spring JDBC and a database driver (e.g., MySQL, H2, etc.).

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
       <artifactId>spring-jdbc</artifactId>
       <version>5.3.10</version>
   </dependency>
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.mysql.cj</groupId>
       <artifactId>mysql-connector-java</artifactId>
       <version>8.0.23</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. **Configure DataSource:**
    A DataSource bean is used to provide a connection to the database.
    Example of configuring a DataSource in your Spring configuration file:

    ```java
    @Configuration
    @EnableTransactionManagement
    @ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.example")
    public class AppConfig {
        @Bean
        public DataSource dataSource() {
            BasicDataSource dataSource = new BasicDataSource();
            dataSource.setUrl("jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb");
            dataSource.setUsername("root");
            dataSource.setPassword("password");
            return dataSource;
        }

        @Bean
        public JdbcTemplate jdbcTemplate() {
            return new JdbcTemplate(dataSource());
        }
    }
    ```

## Performing Data Operations with JDBC Template

### 1. CRUD Operations

#### Create Operation (Insert)
You can insert data into the database using the `update()` method of the `JdbcTemplate`. Here's how you do it:

```java
String sql = "INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary) VALUES (?, ?, ?)";
jdbcTemplate.update(sql, 1, "John Doe", 50000);
```

#### Read Operation (Select)
```java
String sql = "SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = ?";
Employee employee = jdbcTemplate.queryForObject(sql, new Object[]{1}, new BeanPropertyRowMapper<>(Employee.class));
```

#### Update Operation
```java
String sql = "UPDATE employees SET salary = ? WHERE id = ?";
jdbcTemplate.update(sql, 55000, 1);
```

#### Delete Operation
```java
String sql = "DELETE FROM employees WHERE id = ?";
jdbcTemplate.update(sql, 1);
```

## Modeling JDBC Operations as Java Objects

### Introduction
Modeling JDBC operations as Java objects is a key concept in Spring JDBC, enabling you to interact with databases in an object-oriented manner. This approach allows you to represent database rows as Java objects, making your code more readable, maintainable, and decoupled from the underlying database logic.

### 1. Using JavaBeans for Mapping Database Records
In Spring JDBC, we use **JavaBeans** (POJOs) to model database records. A JavaBean is simply a Java class with private fields, public getters and setters, and a no-argument constructor. Each property of the JavaBean corresponds to a column in the database table.

### 2. Mapping JDBC Results to Java Objects
To convert rows from a `ResultSet` into Java objects, you use **RowMapper**. The `RowMapper` interface allows you to implement logic for mapping each row of the result set to a Java object. This helps abstract the conversion logic and promotes code reusability.

### 3. Performing Operations Using JdbcTemplate
Once the JavaBeans and `RowMapper` are set up, Springâ€™s `JdbcTemplate` can be used to perform various database operations. For example:
- **Select queries** can return a list of Java objects.
- **Insert, update, and delete operations** can map Java objects' properties to SQL queries.

### 4. Inserting, Updating, and Deleting Java Objects
Spring JDBC allows you to easily perform insert, update, and delete operations by passing the properties of Java objects to SQL queries. These operations can be done with methods like `update()` in `JdbcTemplate`, making it simple to manage CRUD operations.

### Advantages of Modeling JDBC Operations as Java Objects
- **Cleaner Code:** By using Java objects, the code becomes more readable, reducing the complexity of SQL query management.
- **Type Safety:** Java objects provide type safety, which minimizes errors that could arise from mismatched data types between SQL queries and application logic.
- **Separation of Concerns:** The database interaction logic is decoupled from the business logic, enhancing the maintainability and scalability of your application.
- **Reusability:** Java objects and `RowMapper` implementations can be reused across different parts of the application.

ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Using Java objects for database operations aligns with the object-oriented principles and helps in writing cleaner, more modular code.

## Spring Boot and Database

### Introduction
Spring Boot simplifies the integration between Java applications and databases, providing a seamless way to manage database connections and perform various data operations. With Spring Boot, you can easily set up a data source, configure your database, and use Spring Data JPA, JDBC, or other libraries for database interaction.

### 1. Setting Up Database with Spring Boot
Spring Boot auto-configures the database connection and ORM tools like **JPA**, **Hibernate**, and **JDBC**. You can integrate various databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2) with Spring Boot without the need for complex configuration files.

#### Steps to Configure Database in Spring Boot:
- **Add Dependencies:** Include dependencies for your database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) and JPA or JDBC in the `pom.xml` file.
- **Database Configuration:** Spring Boot uses the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file for configuration. You can configure database connection properties such as the URL, username, password, and Hibernate settings.
- **Auto Configuration:** Spring Boot auto-configures the `DataSource` and related beans if the correct dependencies are available in the classpath.

### 2. Spring Data JPA for Database Operations
Spring Data JPA simplifies database interaction by providing a repository layer for CRUD operations. You only need to define a **Repository** interface, and Spring Data will implement the methods for you.

### 3. Database Operations with Spring Boot

#### CRUD Operations:
With Spring Data JPA, performing CRUD operations becomes easy.
- **Create (Insert):** Use the `save()` method to insert or update an entity.
- **Read (Select):** Use methods like `findById()`, `findAll()`, or custom query methods to retrieve data.
- **Update:** By calling `save()`, you can update an existing record. If the entity exists, it will update the record; otherwise, it will insert a new record.
- **Delete:** You can delete records using methods like `deleteById()`.

### 4. Custom Queries with Spring Data JPA
You can define custom queries using the `@Query` annotation or create complex queries using **JPQL** (Java Persistence Query Language) or **native SQL**.

### 5. Using Spring JDBC Template in Spring Boot
While Spring Data JPA is the preferred way to interact with databases in Spring Boot, you can also use `JdbcTemplate` for more direct database operations.

### Advantages of Using Spring Boot with Database
- **Auto Configuration:** Spring Boot automatically configures database connections and ORM tools, reducing manual configuration.
- **Ease of Use:** Spring Data JPA simplifies data operations by abstracting complex SQL queries and providing a repository layer.
- **Scalability:** Spring Boot offers a highly scalable approach to database interaction, making it ideal for both small and large applications.
- **Integration:** Spring Boot seamlessly integrates with various databases, supporting both SQL and NoSQL databases.

ðŸ’¡ **TIP:** Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration and Spring Data JPA significantly reduce the boilerplate code, making it easier to perform database operations efficiently.

## Spring Boot Web Application Development

### Introduction
Spring Boot makes it easy to build web applications with minimal setup. It provides a comprehensive framework to develop RESTful services, server-side rendered web applications, and more. With built-in features like embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow), Spring Boot reduces the complexities of traditional Spring application setup and configuration.

### 1. Setting Up a Spring Boot Web Application
To start developing a web application with Spring Boot, you need to:
- **Add Spring Web Dependency:** Include the `spring-boot-starter-web` dependency in your `pom.xml` file. This starter brings in everything required to build a web application.
- **Configure Application Properties:** Configure application settings like port, session management, and server properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`.

### 2. Building RESTful Services with Spring Boot
Spring Boot makes it simple to build **RESTful APIs** using `@RestController` annotations. You can easily map HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to Java methods.

#### Key Annotations for RESTful Services:
- `@RestController`: Defines a controller that handles HTTP requests and returns JSON responses.
- `@RequestMapping`: Maps HTTP requests to methods.
- `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`: Shortened versions of `@RequestMapping` for specific HTTP methods.
- `@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam`: Used to capture URL variables or query parameters from HTTP requests.

### 3. Handling Web Requests
In addition to REST APIs, Spring Boot supports traditional web applications using **Thymeleaf** or **JSP** for server-side rendering. You can use `@Controller` to handle HTTP requests and return HTML views.

#### Key Annotations for MVC Applications:
- `@Controller`: Marks a class as a controller for web requests.
- `@RequestMapping`: Specifies the URL for the handler method.
- `ModelAndView`: Used to return both a model and a view name.
- `@GetMapping` / `@PostMapping`: Used to handle GET or POST requests.

### 4. Data Binding and Validation
Spring Boot makes it easy to bind incoming request parameters to Java objects and validate them. You can use `@Valid` and `@NotNull` annotations for validation purposes.

#### Key Annotations for Data Binding and Validation:
- `@Valid`: Tells Spring to validate the object before processing.
- `@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Min`, `@Max`: Validation constraints that can be applied to fields in the model object.
  
### 5. Working with Databases in Web Applications
Spring Boot makes it easy to integrate a database with web applications. You can use **Spring Data JPA**, **Spring JDBC**, or other persistence layers to store data.

- **Spring Data JPA**: Simplifies database interaction using repositories and auto-generated methods.
- **Spring JDBC**: Provides an alternative for direct SQL-based database operations.

### 6. Security in Web Applications
Spring Security provides comprehensive security services for web applications. You can secure REST APIs and traditional web applications with features like authentication, authorization, and CSRF protection.

#### Key Features in Spring Security:
- **Basic Authentication**: Simple username and password-based authentication.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for stateless authentication in REST APIs.
- **Role-based Authorization**: You can define which user roles have access to which resources.

### 7. Error Handling
Spring Boot provides a centralized way of handling errors using `@ControllerAdvice` and `@ExceptionHandler`. You can handle application exceptions globally and send custom error responses.

- **@ControllerAdvice**: A global exception handler that catches exceptions across all controllers.
- **@ExceptionHandler**: Handles specific exceptions in the controller or globally.

### 8. Testing Spring Boot Web Applications
Spring Boot provides powerful testing support for web applications using `@SpringBootTest`, `@WebMvcTest`, and mock objects. You can easily write tests for your controllers, services, and repositories.

- `@SpringBootTest`: Runs the application context for integration tests.
- `@WebMvcTest`: Focuses on testing web layers and controllers.

### 9. Deploying Spring Boot Web Applications
Spring Boot applications are packaged as **self-contained JARs** with embedded web servers (like Tomcat). You can run them with a simple command or deploy them to external servers like **Apache Tomcat**.

#### Steps for Deployment:
- Package your application as a JAR using `mvn package`.
- Run the application using `java -jar your-application.jar`.

### Advantages of Using Spring Boot for Web Application Development
- **Ease of Use:** Spring Bootâ€™s auto-configuration and minimal setup make it easy to get started.
