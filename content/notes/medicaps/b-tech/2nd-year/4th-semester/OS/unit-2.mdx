## CPU Scheduling

### Introduction
CPU scheduling is a crucial function of an operating system that determines which process will use the CPU at any given time. Efficient CPU scheduling is essential for maximizing CPU utilization and ensuring that processes are executed in a timely manner.

### Types of CPU Scheduling Algorithms
There are several CPU scheduling algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Here are some of the most common ones:

#### 1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
- **Description:** Processes are scheduled in the order they arrive in the ready queue.
- **Advantages:**
  - Simple to implement.
  - Fair in terms of process arrival.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Can lead to the "convoy effect," where short processes wait for long processes to complete.

#### 2. Shortest Job Next (SJN)
- **Description:** The process with the smallest execution time is scheduled next.
- **Advantages:**
  - Minimizes average waiting time.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Difficult to predict the length of the next CPU request.
  - Can lead to starvation of longer processes.

#### 3. Round Robin (RR)
- **Description:** Each process is assigned a fixed time slice (quantum) in a cyclic order.
- **Advantages:**
  - Fair allocation of CPU time.
  - Suitable for time-sharing systems.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Performance can degrade with a large number of processes or a very small time quantum.

#### 4. Priority Scheduling
- **Description:** Each process is assigned a priority, and the CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority.
- **Advantages:**
  - Can be effective for time-sensitive tasks.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Can lead to starvation of lower-priority processes.

üí° **TIP:** Choosing the right scheduling algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the system and the types of processes being managed.

üìù **NOTE:** In practice, many operating systems use a combination of these algorithms to optimize performance.

## Scheduling Criteria

### Introduction
Scheduling criteria are the metrics used to evaluate the performance of CPU scheduling algorithms. These criteria help in determining the efficiency and effectiveness of the scheduling process in an operating system.

### Key Scheduling Criteria

#### 1. CPU Utilization
- **Definition:** The percentage of time the CPU is actively working on processes.
- **Goal:** Maximize CPU utilization to ensure that the CPU is busy as much as possible.

#### 2. Throughput
- **Definition:** The number of processes completed per unit of time.
- **Goal:** Maximize throughput to ensure that more processes are finished in a given time frame.

#### 3. Turnaround Time
- **Definition:** The total time taken from the submission of a process to its completion.
- **Calculation:** 
  $ \{text\{Turnaround Time} = \{text\{Completion Time} - \text\{Arrival Time}}} $
- **Goal:** Minimize turnaround time to improve user satisfaction.

#### 4. Waiting Time
- **Definition:** The total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue before it gets CPU time.
- **Calculation:** 
  $ \text\{Waiting Time} = \text\{Turnaround Time} - \text\{Burst Time} $
- **Goal:** Minimize waiting time to enhance the responsiveness of the system.

#### 5. Response Time
- **Definition:** The time from the submission of a request until the first response is produced.
- **Goal:** Minimize response time to ensure that users receive feedback quickly, especially in interactive systems.

### Trade-offs
- Different scheduling algorithms may optimize for different criteria, leading to trade-offs. For example, maximizing CPU utilization may increase waiting time for processes.

üí° **TIP:** Understanding these criteria is essential for selecting the appropriate scheduling algorithm based on the specific needs of the system.

üìù **NOTE:** In real-world applications, a balance between these criteria is often sought to achieve optimal performance.

  - Better CPU utilization as it can switch between processes based on priority.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Increased overhead due to context switching.
  - Complexity in managing process states.

### Non-Preemptive Scheduling
- **Definition:** In non-preemptive scheduling, once a process is allocated the CPU, it runs to completion or until it voluntarily relinquishes control.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Simpler to implement as there is no need for context switching during execution.
  - Processes are executed in the order they arrive or based on priority until they finish.
- **Examples of Non-Preemptive Scheduling Algorithms:**
  - First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
  - Shortest Job First (SJF)
- **Advantages:**
  - Lower overhead due to fewer context switches.
  - Easier to implement and manage.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Poor responsiveness for time-sensitive applications.
  - Can lead to longer waiting times for lower-priority processes.

üí° **TIP:** The choice between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling should be based on the specific requirements of the system and the types of processes being managed.

üìù **NOTE:** Many modern operating systems use a combination of both scheduling types to optimize performance and responsiveness.

## Deadlock

### Introduction
Deadlock is a situation in a multi-tasking environment where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources. This results in a standstill, where none of the involved processes can continue execution.

### Conditions for Deadlock
For a deadlock to occur, the following four conditions must hold simultaneously:

#### 1. Mutual Exclusion
- **Definition:** At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode. If another process requests that resource, the requesting process must be delayed until the resource is released.

#### 2. Hold and Wait
- **Definition:** A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other processes.

#### 3. No Preemption
- **Definition:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process holding them; they must be voluntarily released.

#### 4. Circular Wait
- **Definition:** A set of processes are waiting for each other in a circular chain. For example, Process A is waiting for a resource held by Process B, Process B is waiting for a resource held by Process C, and Process C is waiting for a resource held by Process A.

### Deadlock Prevention Strategies
To avoid deadlocks, systems can implement one or more of the following strategies:

#### 1. Eliminate Mutual Exclusion
- **Approach:** Make all resources shareable. However, this is not feasible for all resource types.

#### 2. Eliminate Hold and Wait
- **Approach:** Require processes to request all required resources at once, or to release all held resources before requesting new ones.

#### 3. Eliminate No Preemption
- **Approach:** Allow preemption of resources from processes. If a process is holding resources and requests another that cannot be allocated, it must release its held resources.

#### 4. Eliminate Circular Wait
- **Approach:** Impose a strict ordering of resource allocation. Processes must request resources in a predefined order to prevent circular wait conditions.

### Deadlock Detection and Recovery
If deadlocks cannot be prevented, systems can implement detection and recovery mechanisms:

#### 1. Deadlock Detection
- **Approach:** Periodically check the system for deadlocks using resource allocation graphs or wait-for graphs.
- **Algorithm:** Use algorithms like the Banker's algorithm to detect cycles in resource allocation.

#### 2. Deadlock Recovery
- **Approach:** Once a deadlock is detected, the system can take actions such as:
  - Terminating one or more processes involved in the deadlock.
  - Preempting resources from processes to break the deadlock.

### Conclusion
Deadlock is a critical issue in operating systems that can severely impact performance. Understanding the conditions that lead to deadlock and implementing effective prevention, detection, and recovery strategies is essential for maintaining system stability.

üí° **TIP:** Regularly monitor resource allocation and process states to identify potential deadlocks early.

üìù **NOTE:** Designing systems with deadlock prevention in mind can save significant time and resources in the long run.

## Deadlock Problem

### Introduction
The deadlock problem refers to a specific situation in a multi-tasking environment where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources. This results in a complete halt of the involved processes, leading to system inefficiency and resource wastage.

### Example of the Deadlock Problem
Consider two processes, **P1** and **P2**, and two resources, **R1** and **R2**:

1. **P1** holds **R1** and requests **R2**.
2. **P2** holds **R2** and requests **R1**.

This creates a circular wait condition:
- **P1** is waiting for **R2** held by **P2**.
- **P2** is waiting for **R1** held by **P1**.

As a result, neither process can proceed, leading to a deadlock.

### Characteristics of the Deadlock Problem
The deadlock problem is characterized by the following:

#### 1. Resource Allocation
- Resources are finite and can be allocated to processes. When processes hold resources and request additional ones, deadlocks can occur.

#### 2. Process States
- Processes can be in various states: running, waiting, or blocked. In a deadlock, processes are typically in a waiting state, unable to transition to running.

#### 3. Circular Wait
- The presence of a circular wait condition is a key characteristic of deadlocks. This condition arises when processes are waiting on each other in a circular chain.

### Impact of Deadlocks
- **System Performance:** Deadlocks can severely degrade system performance, leading to unresponsive applications and wasted resources.
- **Resource Utilization:** Resources held by deadlocked processes cannot be used by other processes, leading to inefficient resource utilization.

### Strategies to Address the Deadlock Problem

#### 1. Deadlock Prevention
- Implement strategies to prevent the occurrence of deadlocks by ensuring that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot hold.

#### 2. Deadlock Avoidance
- Use algorithms like the Banker's algorithm to dynamically allocate resources while ensuring that the system remains in a safe state.

#### 3. Deadlock Detection
- Periodically check for deadlocks using resource allocation graphs or wait-for graphs to identify cycles in resource allocation.

#### 4. Deadlock Recovery
- Once a deadlock is detected, take actions such as terminating one or more processes involved in the deadlock or preempting resources to break the deadlock.

### Conclusion
The deadlock problem is a significant challenge in operating systems that can lead to severe performance issues. Understanding the nature of deadlocks and implementing effective strategies for prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery is essential for maintaining system stability and efficiency.

üí° **TIP:** Regularly review resource allocation policies and process management strategies to minimize the risk of deadlocks.

üìù **NOTE:** Designing systems with deadlock considerations can enhance overall system reliability and performance.

## Deadlock Characterization

### Introduction
Deadlock characterization involves identifying and defining the conditions that lead to a deadlock situation in a multi-tasking environment. Understanding these characteristics is crucial for developing strategies to prevent, avoid, or resolve deadlocks.

### Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
For a deadlock to occur, the following four conditions must hold simultaneously:

#### 1. Mutual Exclusion
- **Definition:** At least one resource must be held in a non-shareable mode. If another process requests that resource, the requesting process must be delayed until the resource is released.
- **Example:** A printer can only be used by one process at a time.

#### 2. Hold and Wait
- **Definition:** A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently being held by other processes.
- **Example:** A process that has been allocated memory is waiting for a disk to become available.

#### 3. No Preemption
- **Definition:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process holding them; they must be voluntarily released.
- **Example:** If a process is holding a lock on a resource, it cannot be preempted by the operating system to release that resource.

#### 4. Circular Wait
- **Definition:** A set of processes are waiting for each other in a circular chain. For instance, Process A is waiting for a resource held by Process B, Process B is waiting for a resource held by Process C, and Process C is waiting for a resource held by Process A.
- **Example:** In a circular wait, if Process 1 is waiting for a resource held by Process 2, and Process 2 is waiting for a resource held by Process 1, a deadlock occurs.

### Visual Representation of Deadlock
A resource allocation graph can be used to visually represent the relationships between processes and resources. In this graph:
- **Processes** are represented as circles.
- **Resources** are represented as squares.
- **Edges** indicate the allocation of resources to processes and the requests made by processes.

### Importance of Characterization
Understanding the characterization of deadlocks is essential for:
- **Deadlock Prevention:** By ensuring that at least one of the necessary conditions does not hold, systems can prevent deadlocks from occurring.
- **Deadlock Detection:** Identifying the conditions that lead to deadlocks helps in developing algorithms to detect them in a timely manner.
- **Deadlock Recovery:** Knowing how deadlocks occur allows for the design of effective recovery strategies to resolve them.

### Conclusion
Deadlock characterization is a fundamental aspect of operating systems that helps in understanding how deadlocks arise and how they can be managed. By recognizing the necessary conditions for deadlock, system designers can implement strategies to mitigate the risks associated with deadlocks.

üí° **TIP:** Regularly analyze resource allocation patterns to identify potential deadlock scenarios.

üìù **NOTE:** Awareness of deadlock characterization can lead to more robust and efficient system designs.

## Deadlock Prevention

### Introduction
Deadlock prevention involves implementing strategies to ensure that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot hold. By preventing deadlocks, systems can maintain smooth operation and avoid the inefficiencies associated with deadlock situations.

### Four Necessary Conditions for Deadlock
To effectively prevent deadlocks, it is essential to understand the four conditions that must hold simultaneously for a deadlock to occur:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**
2. **Hold and Wait**
3. **No Preemption**
4. **Circular Wait**

### Strategies for Deadlock Prevention

#### 1. Eliminate Mutual Exclusion
- **Approach:** Make resources shareable whenever possible. For example, allow multiple processes to read from a resource simultaneously.
- **Limitations:** This approach is not feasible for all resource types, such as printers or exclusive locks.

#### 2. Eliminate Hold and Wait
- **Approach:** Require processes to request all required resources at once before execution begins. Alternatively, processes can be required to release all held resources before requesting new ones.
- **Implementation:** 
  - **All-or-Nothing Request:** A process must request all resources it needs at the start.
  - **Resource Allocation Protocol:** Processes must release resources before requesting additional ones.
- **Limitations:** This can lead to inefficient resource utilization and increased waiting times.

#### 3. Eliminate No Preemption
- **Approach:** Allow preemption of resources from processes. If a process holding resources requests additional resources that cannot be allocated, it must release its held resources.
- **Implementation:** 
  - **Forced Release:** The system can forcibly take resources from a process if it is in a waiting state.
- **Limitations:** This can lead to increased overhead and complexity in managing resource states.

#### 4. Eliminate Circular Wait
- **Approach:** Impose a strict ordering of resource allocation. Processes must request resources in a predefined order to prevent circular wait conditions.
- **Implementation:** 
  - **Resource Hierarchy:** Define a global order for resource types, and require processes to request resources in that order.
- **Limitations:** This can complicate resource management and may lead to underutilization of resources.

### Conclusion
Deadlock prevention is a proactive approach to managing resources in a multi-tasking environment. By implementing strategies that eliminate one or more of the necessary conditions for deadlock, systems can enhance reliability and performance.

üí° **TIP:** Regularly review and adjust resource allocation policies to minimize the risk of deadlocks.

üìù **NOTE:** While deadlock prevention can improve system stability, it may also introduce complexity and reduce resource utilization.

---

## Deadlock Avoidance

### Introduction
Deadlock avoidance is a strategy used in operating systems to ensure that a system never enters a deadlock state. Unlike deadlock prevention, which eliminates one of the necessary conditions for deadlock, deadlock avoidance allows the system to make resource allocation decisions dynamically based on the current state of resource availability and process requests.

### Key Concepts

#### Safe State
- **Definition:** A state is considered safe if there exists a sequence of processes that can finish executing without causing a deadlock. In a safe state, the system can allocate resources to processes in such a way that all processes can eventually complete.
- **Importance:** Ensuring that the system remains in a safe state is crucial for deadlock avoidance.

#### Unsafe State
- **Definition:** A state is considered unsafe if there is no guarantee that all processes can complete without leading to a deadlock.
- **Implication:** Transitioning to an unsafe state can lead to potential deadlocks.

### Deadlock Avoidance Algorithms

#### 1. Banker's Algorithm
- **Description:** The Banker's algorithm is a well-known deadlock avoidance algorithm that simulates resource allocation for processes. It checks whether granting a resource request will leave the system in a safe state.
- **How It Works:**
  - Each process must declare the maximum number of resources it may need.
  - The system maintains a record of available resources, allocated resources, and maximum resources for each process.
  - When a process requests resources, the system checks if granting the request keeps the system in a safe state.
- **Advantages:**
  - Provides a systematic way to avoid deadlocks.
  - Ensures that resources are allocated only if it is safe to do so.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires knowledge of maximum resource needs, which may not always be feasible.
  - Can lead to underutilization of resources if processes do not declare their maximum needs accurately.

#### 2. Resource Allocation Graph (RAG)
- **Description:** A resource allocation graph is a directed graph that represents the allocation of resources to processes. It helps in visualizing the relationships between processes and resources.
- **How It Works:**
  - Nodes represent processes and resources.
  - Edges indicate allocation (from resource to process) and requests (from process to resource).
  - A cycle in the graph indicates a potential deadlock.
- **Advantages:**
  - Provides a clear visual representation of resource allocation.
  - Allows for easy detection of deadlock conditions.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Complexity increases with the number of processes and resources.
  - May require additional overhead for maintaining the graph.

### Conclusion
Deadlock avoidance is a critical aspect of resource management in operating systems. By ensuring that the system remains in a safe state and using algorithms like the Banker's algorithm, systems can effectively prevent deadlocks while allowing for efficient resource allocation.

üí° **TIP:** Regularly monitor resource allocation patterns to identify potential unsafe states.

üìù **NOTE:** Implementing deadlock avoidance strategies can enhance system reliability and performance, but may also introduce complexity in resource management.

## Deadlock Detection

### Introduction
Deadlock detection is the process of identifying deadlocks in a system where multiple processes compete for resources. Unlike deadlock prevention and avoidance, which aim to prevent deadlocks from occurring, deadlock detection allows the system to identify when a deadlock has occurred and take appropriate action to resolve it.

### Deadlock Detection Algorithms

#### 1. Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) Algorithm
- **Description:** A resource allocation graph is a directed graph that represents the allocation of resources to processes. It consists of nodes representing processes and resources, and edges indicating allocation and request relationships.
- **How It Works:**
  - **Allocation Edge:** An edge from a resource node to a process node indicates that the resource is currently allocated to the process.
  - **Request Edge:** An edge from a process node to a resource node indicates that the process is requesting that resource.
  - A cycle in the graph indicates a deadlock.
- **Advantages:**
  - Provides a clear visual representation of resource allocation.
  - Simple to implement for systems with a limited number of resources and processes.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Becomes complex with a large number of processes and resources.
  - Requires continuous monitoring of the graph.

#### 2. Wait-For Graph Algorithm
- **Description:** A wait-for graph is a simplified version of the resource allocation graph that focuses only on processes and their wait relationships.
- **How It Works:**
  - Nodes represent processes.
  - An edge from Process A to Process B indicates that Process A is waiting for a resource held by Process B.
  - A cycle in the wait-for graph indicates a deadlock.
- **Advantages:**
  - Reduces complexity by focusing only on processes.
  - Easier to analyze for deadlock detection.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Does not provide information about resource allocation.

### Deadlock Detection Process
1. **Monitor Resource Allocation:** Continuously track the allocation of resources to processes and their requests.
2. **Construct Graphs:** Maintain resource allocation and wait-for graphs to visualize relationships.
3. **Cycle Detection:** Periodically check for cycles in the graphs to identify potential deadlocks.
4. **Deadlock Reporting:** If a cycle is detected, report the deadlock and identify the processes involved.

### Recovery from Deadlock
Once a deadlock is detected, the system must take action to resolve it. Common recovery strategies include:

#### 1. Process Termination
- **Description:** Terminate one or more processes involved in the deadlock to break the cycle.
- **Strategies:**
  - **Kill All Deadlocked Processes:** Terminate all processes involved in the deadlock.
  - **Kill Processes One at a Time:** Terminate processes based on priority or resource usage until the deadlock is resolved.

#### 2. Resource Preemption
- **Description:** Preempt resources from one or more processes to break the deadlock.
- **Considerations:**
  - Determine which resources can be preempted and which processes will be affected.
  - Ensure that preempted processes can be rolled back to a safe state.

### Conclusion
Deadlock detection is a vital aspect of resource management in operating systems. By implementing effective detection algorithms and recovery strategies, systems can identify and resolve deadlocks, ensuring smooth operation and resource utilization.

üí° **TIP:** Regularly review and optimize resource allocation policies to minimize the likelihood of deadlocks.

üìù **NOTE:** While deadlock detection allows for recovery, it is often more efficient to implement prevention or avoidance strategies to maintain system stability.

## Recovery From Deadlock

### Introduction
Recovery from deadlock involves taking actions to resolve a deadlock situation once it has been detected. The goal is to restore the system to a normal operational state while minimizing the impact on processes and resources.

### Strategies for Recovery from Deadlock

#### 1. Process Termination
- **Description:** One or more processes involved in the deadlock are terminated to break the cycle.
- **Strategies:**
  - **Kill All Deadlocked Processes:** Terminate all processes that are part of the deadlock. This is the simplest approach but can lead to significant resource loss.
  - **Kill Processes One at a Time:** Terminate processes based on specific criteria, such as:
    - **Priority:** Terminate the lowest priority process first.
    - **Resource Utilization:** Terminate the process that has used the least amount of resources.
    - **Process Age:** Terminate the oldest process first to minimize the impact on long-running tasks.
- **Advantages:**
  - Simple to implement and understand.
  - Quickly resolves the deadlock situation.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Can lead to loss of progress and data for terminated processes.
  - May require processes to restart, leading to additional overhead.

#### 2. Resource Preemption
- **Description:** Resources are forcibly taken from one or more processes to break the deadlock.
- **Considerations:**
  - Determine which resources can be preempted and which processes will be affected.
  - Ensure that preempted processes can be rolled back to a safe state if necessary.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Roll Back:** If a process is preempted, it may need to be rolled back to a previously saved state to ensure consistency.
  - **Reallocate Resources:** After preemption, resources are reallocated to other processes to allow them to proceed.
- **Advantages:**
  - Allows for continued execution of other processes while resolving the deadlock.
  - Can minimize the overall impact on system performance.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Complexity in managing resource states and ensuring consistency.
  - Potential for additional overhead due to rolling back processes.

### Conclusion
Recovery from deadlock is a critical aspect of operating system design. By implementing effective recovery strategies, systems can minimize the impact of deadlocks and maintain smooth operation. The choice of recovery method depends on the specific requirements of the system and the nature of the processes involved.

üí° **TIP:** Regularly monitor system performance and resource allocation to identify potential deadlock situations early.

üìù **NOTE:** While recovery strategies can resolve deadlocks, it is often more efficient to implement prevention or avoidance strategies to maintain system stability.

## Methods for Deadlock Handling

### Introduction
Deadlock handling refers to the strategies and techniques used by operating systems to manage deadlocks when they occur. There are several methods for handling deadlocks, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The choice of method depends on the system requirements and the nature of the processes involved.

### Methods for Deadlock Handling

#### 1. Deadlock Prevention
- **Description:** This method aims to prevent deadlocks from occurring by ensuring that at least one of the necessary conditions for deadlock cannot hold.
- **Key Strategies:**
  - **Eliminate Mutual Exclusion:** Make resources shareable whenever possible.
  - **Eliminate Hold and Wait:** Require processes to request all resources at once or release held resources before requesting new ones.
  - **Eliminate No Preemption:** Allow resources to be forcibly taken from processes.
  - **Eliminate Circular Wait:** Impose a strict ordering of resource allocation.
- **Advantages:**
  - Reduces the likelihood of deadlocks occurring.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Can lead to inefficient resource utilization and increased waiting times.

#### 2. Deadlock Avoidance
- **Description:** This method allows the system to make resource allocation decisions dynamically to ensure that it never enters an unsafe state.
- **Key Strategies:**
  - **Banker's Algorithm:** A well-known algorithm that checks whether granting a resource request will leave the system in a safe state.
  - **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG):** A graph that helps visualize resource allocation and detect potential deadlocks.
- **Advantages:**
  - Provides a systematic way to avoid deadlocks while allowing for resource allocation.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires knowledge of maximum resource needs, which may not always be feasible.

#### 3. Deadlock Detection
- **Description:** This method involves periodically checking the system for deadlocks using algorithms that analyze resource allocation and process states.
- **Key Strategies:**
  - **Resource Allocation Graph (RAG) Algorithm:** Detects cycles in the resource allocation graph to identify deadlocks.
  - **Wait-For Graph Algorithm:** Focuses on processes and their wait relationships to detect deadlocks.
- **Advantages:**
  - Allows the system to identify deadlocks after they occur.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Requires additional overhead for monitoring and detection.

#### 4. Deadlock Recovery
- **Description:** Once a deadlock is detected, recovery methods are employed to resolve the deadlock and restore normal operation.
- **Key Strategies:**
  - **Process Termination:** Terminate one or more processes involved in the deadlock.
  - **Resource Preemption:** Forcibly take resources from one or more processes to break the deadlock.
- **Advantages:**
  - Quickly resolves deadlock situations.
- **Disadvantages:**
  - Can lead to loss of progress and data for terminated processes.

### Conclusion
Handling deadlocks effectively is crucial for maintaining system stability and performance. By implementing prevention, avoidance, detection, and recovery methods, operating systems can manage deadlocks and ensure smooth operation.

üí° **TIP:** Regularly review and optimize resource allocation policies to minimize the risk of deadlocks.

üìù **NOTE:** A combination of methods may be necessary to effectively handle deadlocks in complex systems.
