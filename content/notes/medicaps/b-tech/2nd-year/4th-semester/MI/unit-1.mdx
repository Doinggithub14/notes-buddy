## External Address/Data Bus Multiplexing in Intel 8085 Microprocessor  

The Intel 8085 microprocessor uses **multiplexing** for its **external address/data bus** to reduce the number of pins required. The address and data lines share the same physical pins, and a mechanism is used to differentiate between the address and data during different phases of operation. This allows the microprocessor to utilize fewer pins for both **addressing** and **data transfer**.

---

### Why is Bus Multiplexing Used?  

- **Pin Minimization:**  
  The Intel 8085 microprocessor has only 40 pins. Multiplexing reduces the number of pins needed for address and data lines, saving space and simplifying the design of the chip.  
- **Efficient Use of Resources:**  
  By reusing the same set of pins for both address and data, the microprocessor can execute read and write operations effectively without requiring additional pins for each function.

---

### Address/Data Bus Multiplexing in Intel 8085  

#### 1. **Pin Sharing**  
- The **A15-A8** (higher address) and **D7-D0** (data) lines share the same pins.  
- The **A15-A0** lines are multiplexed with **D7-D0** lines on pins **1 to 19**.  
  - **Pins A15-A8** are used as **address lines** during the **address phase** of a memory or I/O operation.  
  - **Pins D7-D0** are used as **data lines** during the **data phase**.  

#### 2. **Role of ALE (Address Latch Enable)**  
- The **ALE (Address Latch Enable)** signal plays a critical role in the multiplexing process.  
- When **ALE** is **high**, the address portion (A15-A8) on the multiplexed bus is **latched** by external hardware (usually a latch), and the microprocessor can use these address lines in the **address phase**.  
- When **ALE** is **low**, the microprocessor is in the **data phase**, and the same pins are used to carry the **data**.  
- This mechanism ensures that the correct address is retained during the entire cycle while the data is transferred separately.

#### 3. **External Latch**  
- An **external latch** (such as the **74LS373**) is used to capture the address during the **address phase** when ALE is active.  
- This latch holds the address stable while the **data bus** is used for transferring data in the subsequent **data phase**.

---

### Working of Address/Data Bus Multiplexing  

1. **Memory or I/O Operation Begins:**  
   - The microprocessor places the **address** on the **multiplexed pins** (A15-A0) during the **address phase** of the operation.  
   - **ALE** goes high to latch the address into an external latch.

2. **Data Phase:**  
   - After the address is latched, the microprocessor uses the same pins to place **data** (D7-D0) during the **data phase**.  
   - The microprocessor performs a read or write operation, with the data being either read from memory or an I/O device, or written to memory or I/O.

3. **Timing Signals:**  
   - **ALE** is the key signal to distinguish between address and data.  
   - The **I/O/M** signal determines whether the operation is a memory or I/O operation, while the **RD** and **WR** control signals determine whether data is being read or written.

---

### Benefits of Address/Data Bus Multiplexing  

#### 1. **Reduced Pin Count:**  
   - By sharing the address and data lines, the microprocessor can operate with fewer pins, which helps reduce the complexity and cost of the chip.

#### 2. **Simplified Design:**  
   - The use of a single set of lines for both addressing and data transfer makes the external circuitry simpler, requiring only a single **external latch** for address latching.

#### 3. **Efficient Data Transfer:**  
   - Multiplexing ensures that the microprocessor can perform both **addressing** and **data transfer** sequentially without requiring separate buses for each operation.

## De-multiplexing in Intel 8085 Microprocessor  

De-multiplexing is the process used to **separate the address and data lines** in a multiplexed bus. In the Intel 8085 microprocessor, the address and data share the same set of pins during operation. **De-multiplexing** is the technique used to retrieve the address from the multiplexed bus and place it onto the address bus while allowing the data to be transmitted separately during the data phase of memory or I/O operations.

---

### Why is De-multiplexing Necessary?  

- **Address/Data Bus Sharing:**  
  In the Intel 8085 microprocessor, the **same pins** (A15-A0) serve for both **address** and **data** transfer due to bus multiplexing.  
- **Separation of Address and Data:**  
  To ensure accurate memory access and data transfer, the address and data need to be **separated** during operations.  
- **Efficient Communication:**  
  De-multiplexing ensures that the **address** is latched during the **address phase**, and the **data** is placed on the bus during the **data phase**, ensuring proper communication with memory and I/O devices.

---

### How Does De-multiplexing Work in Intel 8085?  

#### 1. **Role of Address Latch Enable (ALE):**  
- The **ALE (Address Latch Enable)** signal is crucial in the de-multiplexing process.  
- When **ALE** is high, it signals that the **address lines (A15-A8)** are valid. At this point, the address is **latched** by an **external latch** (such as the **74LS373**), separating the address from the data bus.  
- The **address** is retained by the latch, ensuring that the microprocessor can access the memory or I/O device with the correct address while the data is transferred in the subsequent phase.

#### 2. **Data Phase:**  
- After the **address phase**, the microprocessor performs a **data transfer** on the same lines (A15-A0) for the **data phase**.  
- During this phase, the **data lines (D7-D0)** carry the **data** to or from the memory or I/O device.  

#### 3. **External Latch and Buffer:**  
- An **external latch** is used to **latch** the **address** when **ALE** is active.  
- Once the address is latched, the data bus (D7-D0) is used to transfer the **data** during the **data phase**.  
- This process allows the address and data to be **separated** and used efficiently without interference.

---

### Steps in De-multiplexing Process  

1. **Microprocessor Places Address:**  
   - The microprocessor places the address on the multiplexed pins (A15-A0).  
   - **ALE** goes high, indicating that the address portion of the bus is valid.

2. **Address Latching:**  
   - The **address lines (A15-A8)** are latched into an **external latch** (74LS373 or similar) while **ALE** is high.  
   - The latched address remains stable during the **data phase**.

3. **Data Phase:**  
   - After the address is latched, the microprocessor places the **data** on the same pins (D7-D0).  
   - The microprocessor can now perform a **read** or **write** operation using the data bus.

4. **Address and Data Separation:**  
   - The **address** and **data** are **separated** by the **external latch** and the **ALE** signal.  
   - The microprocessor can interact with memory and I/O devices with the correct address while transferring data separately.

---

### Key Components in De-multiplexing  

#### 1. **ALE (Address Latch Enable)**  
- **Function:** Enables the latching of the **address** during the **address phase**.
- **Active High:** When ALE is high, the address is valid and latched into an external latch.
- **Active Low:** When ALE is low, the data phase begins, and the address is no longer needed.

#### 2. **External Latch**  
- **Function:** Captures the **address** from the multiplexed bus.
- **Example Latch:** A commonly used external latch is the **74LS373**, which stores the address from the A15-A8 lines during the address phase.

#### 3. **Multiplexed Address/Data Bus**  
- **Pins:** A15-A0 and D7-D0 share the same lines.  
- **Address Phase:** A15-A8 lines hold the address, while D7-D0 remains unused for data.
- **Data Phase:** D7-D0 lines carry data, while the address is already latched.

---

### Benefits of De-multiplexing  

- **Fewer Pins Required:**  
  By using multiplexing and de-multiplexing, the microprocessor can perform both **addressing** and **data transfer** using the same set of pins, reducing the number of pins needed.

- **Optimized Use of Resources:**  
  De-multiplexing allows the microprocessor to effectively separate the address and data during different phases of operation, ensuring smooth data transfer and memory access.

- **Simplified Design:**  
  The use of an external latch and **ALE** signal makes the design simpler, with fewer pins and components needed to handle the address and data separately.
